Fra_1,Georges Seurat,Oil on canvas,A Sunday on La Grande Jatte — 1884,"In his best-known and largest painting, Georges Seurat depicted people from different social classes strolling and relaxing in a park just west of Paris on La Grande Jatte, an island in the Seine River. Although he took his subject from modern life, Seurat sought to evoke the sense of timelessness associated with ancient art, especially Egyptian and Greek sculpture. He once wrote, “I want to make modern people, in their essential traits, move about as they do on those friezes, and place them on canvases organized by harmonies of color.”Seurat painted A Sunday on La Grande Jatte—1884 using pointillism, a highly systematic and scientific technique based on the hypothesis that closely positioned points of pure color mix together in the viewer’s eye. He began work on the canvas in 1884 (and included this date in the title) with a layer of small, horizontal brushstrokes in complementary colors. He next added a series of dots that coalesce into solid and luminous forms when seen from a distance. Sometime before 1889 Seurat added a border of blue, orange, and red dots that provide a visual transition between the painting’s interior and the specially designed white frame, which has been re-created at the Art Institute.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/27992/a-sunday-on-la-grande-jatte-1884
Fra_2,Henri Matisse,Oil on canvas,Bathers by a River,"Henri Matisse considered Bathers by a River to be one of the five most “pivotal” works of his career, and with good reason: it facilitated the evolution of the artist’s style over the course of nearly a decade. Originally, the work was related to a 1909 commission by the Russian collector Sergei Shchukin, who wanted two large canvases to decorate the staircase of his Moscow home. Matisse proposed three pastoral images, though Shchukin decided to purchase only two works, Dance II and Music (both State Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg).Four years later, Matisse returned to this canvas, the rejected third image, altering the idyllic scene and changing the pastel palette to reflect his new interest in Cubism. He reordered the composition, making the figures more columnar, with faceless, ovoid heads. Over the next years, Matisse transformed the background into four vertical bands and turned the formerly blue river into a thick black vertical band. With its restricted palette and severely abstracted forms, Bathers by a River is far removed from Dance II and Music, which convey a graceful lyricism. The sobriety and hint of danger in Bathers by a River may in part reflect the artist’s concerns during the terrible, war-torn period during which he completed it.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/79307/bathers-by-a-river
Fra_3,Claude Monet,Oil on canvas,Stacks of Wheat (End of Summer),"The monumental stacks that Claude Monet depicted in his series Stacks of Wheat rose fifteen to twenty feet and stood just outside the artist’s farmhouse at Giverny. Through 1890 and 1891, he worked on this series both in the field, painting simultaneously at several easels, and in the studio, refining pictorial harmonies. In May 1891, Monet hung fifteen of these canvases next to each other in one small room in the Galerie Durand-Ruel in Paris. An unprecedented critical and financial success, the exhibition marked a breakthrough in Monet’s career, as well as in the history of French art. In this view, and in nearly all of the autumn views in the series, the conical tops of the stacks break the horizon and push into the sky. But in most of the winter views, which constitute the core of the series, the stacks seem wrapped by bands of hill and field, as if bedded down for the season. For Monet, the stack was a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival. He followed this group with further series depicting poplars, the facade of Rouen Cathedral, and, later, his own garden at Giverny. The Art Institute has the largest group of Monet’s Stacks of Wheat in the world.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/64818/stacks-of-wheat-end-of-summer
Fra_4,Claude Monet,Oil on canvas,Water Lilies,"“One instant, one aspect of nature contains it all,” said Claude Monet, referring to his late masterpieces, the water landscapes that he produced at his home in Giverny between 1897 and his death in 1926. These works replaced the varied contemporary subjects he had painted from the 1870s through the 1890s with a single, timeless motif—water lilies. The focal point of these paintings was the artist’s beloved ﬂower garden, which featured a water garden and a smaller pond spanned by a Japanese footbridge. In his first water-lily series (1897–99), Monet painted the pond environment, with its plants, bridge, and trees neatly divided by a fixed horizon. Over time, the artist became less and less concerned with conventional pictorial space. By the time he painted Water Lilies, which comes from his third group of these works, he had dispensed with the horizon line altogether. In this spatially ambiguous canvas, the artist looked down, focusing solely on the surface of the pond, with its cluster of vegetation ﬂoating amid the reﬂection of sky and trees. Monet thus created the image of a horizontal surface on a vertical one.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16568/water-lilies
Fra_5,Pierre-Auguste Renoir,Oil on canvas,Two Sisters (On the Terrace),"“He loves everything that is joyous, brilliant, and consoling in life,” an anonymous interviewer once wrote about Pierre-Auguste Renoir. This may explain why Two Sisters (On the Terrace) is one of the most popular paintings in the Art Institute. Here Renoir depicted the radiance of lovely young women on a warm and beautiful day. The older girl, wearing the female boater’s blue ﬂannel, is posed in the center of the evocative landscape backdrop of Chatou, a suburban town where the artist spent much of the spring of 1881. She gazes absently beyond her younger companion, who seems, in a charming visual conceit, to have just dashed into the picture. Technically, the painting is a tour de force: Renoir juxtaposed solid, almost life-size figures against a landscape that—like a stage set—seems a realm of pure vision and fantasy. The sewing basket in the left foreground evokes a palette, holding the bright, pure pigments that the artist mixed, diluted, and altered to create the rest of the painting. Although the girls were not actually sisters, Renoir’s dealer showed the work with this title, along with Acrobats at the Cirque Fernando and others, at the seventh Impressionist exhibition, in 1882.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/14655/two-sisters-on-the-terrace
Fra_6,Mary Cassatt,Oil on canvas,The Child’s Bath,"In this work, Mary Cassatt addressed the theme for which she is best known—women and children—while also experimenting with compositional elements of Japanese art. Cassatt saw a large exhibition of Japanese prints at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris in 1890, and produced a series of prints influenced by their aesthetics. The Child’s Bath is the culmination of her investigation of a flattened picture plane and decorative patterning. The intimate scene of everyday life also echoes the subject of many Japanese prints. In Cassatt’s painting, the encircling arms and gentle touch of the mother or nurse convey an overall feeling of protection and tenderness.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/111442/the-child-s-bath
Fra_7,Marc Chagall,Oil on canvas,White Crucifixion,"White Crucifixion is the first in Marc Chagall’s series of compositions that feature Jesus as a Jewish martyr and dramatically call attention to the persecution and suffering of Jews in 1930s Germany at the hands of the National Socialist Party. Chagall stressed Jesus’s religious identity by depicting him and the biblical figures above him in traditional Jewish garments. The surrounding images show the devastation of pogroms, violent attacks against Jewish communities often organized or sanctioned by local governments. Combining the Crucifixion with contemporary events, Chagall’s painting links the martyred Jesus with the Jewish people being persecuted across Europe and implicitly compares the Nazis with Jesus’s tormentors.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/59426/white-crucifixion
Fra_8,Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec,Oil on canvas,At the Moulin Rouge,"Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec has been associated with the Moulin Rouge since its opening in 1889: the owner of the legendary nightclub bought the artist’s Equestrienne as a decoration for the foyer. Toulouse-Lautrec populated At the Moulin Rouge with portraits of the legendary nightclub’s regulars, including himself—the diminutive figure in the center background—accompanied by his cousin, physician Gabriel Tapié de Céleyran. Dancer La Goulue arranges her hair behind the table where Jane Avril, another famous performer, socializes. Singer May Milton peers out from the right edge of the painting, her face harshly lit and acid green. At some point, the artist or his dealer cut down the canvas to remove Milton, perhaps because her strange appearance made the work hard to sell. Whatever the reason, by 1914 the cut section had been reattached to the painting.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/61128/at-the-moulin-rouge
Fra_9,Claude Monet,Oil on canvas,"Arrival of the Normandy Train, Gare Saint-Lazare","The Impressionists frequently paid tribute to the modern aspects of Paris. Their paintings abound with scenes of grand boulevards and elegant, new blocks of buildings, as well as achievements of modern construction such as iron bridges, exhibition halls, and train sheds. Arrival of the Normandy Train, Gare Saint-Lazare was an especially appropriate choice of subject for Claude Monet in the 1870s. The terminal, linking Paris and Normandy, where Monet’s technique of painting outdoors had been nurtured in the 1860s, was also the point of departure for towns and villages to the west and north of Paris frequented by the Impressionists. Monet completed eight of his twelve known paintings of the Gare Saint-Lazare in time for the third Impressionist exhibition, in 1877, probably placing them in the same gallery.Monet chose to focus his attention here on the glass-and-iron train shed, where he found an appealing combination of artificial and natural effects: the rising steam of locomotives trapped within the structure, and daylight penetrating the large, glazed sections of the roof. Monet’s depictions of the station inaugurated what was to become for him an established pattern of painting a specific motif repeatedly in order to capture subtle and temporal atmospheric changes. But the series also represented his last attempt to deal with urban realities: from this point on in his career, Monet would be largely a painter of landscapes.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16571/arrival-of-the-normandy-train-gare-saint-lazare
Fra_10,Marc Chagall,Stained glass,America Windows,"Marc Chagall made America Windows to celebrate the US Bicentennial and presented them as a gift to the Art Institute of Chicago in 1977. The windows merge symbols of US history, the Chicago skyline, and the arts; read from left to right, the panels represent music, painting, literature, architecture, theater, and dance.Best known as a painter, Chagall had been working in stained glass for several decades by the 1970s. He was drawn to the medium as a way to explore intense color on a monumental scale. Working with stained-glass maker Charles Marq, Chagall executed 86 windows across Europe, Israel, and the United States.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/109439/america-windows
Fra_11,Paul Cezanne,Oil on canvas,The Basket of Apples,"Art, Paul Cézanne once claimed, is “a harmony running parallel to nature,” not an imitation of nature. In his quest for underlying structure and composition, he recognized that the artist is not bound to represent real objects in real space. Thus, The Basket of Apples contains one of his signature tilted tables, an impossible rectangle with no right angles. On it, a basket of apples pitches forward from a slablike base, seemingly balanced by the bottle and the tablecloth’s thick, sculptural folds. The heavy modeling, solid brushstrokes, and glowing colors give the composition a density and dynamism that a more realistic still life could never possess. This painting, one of Cézanne’s rare signed works, was part of an important exhibition urged on the artist by the Parisian art dealer Ambroise Vollard in 1895. Since Cézanne had spent the majority of his career painting in isolation in his native Provence, this was the first opportunity in nearly twenty years for the public to see the work of the artist who is now hailed as the father of modern painting.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/111436/the-basket-of-apples
Fra_12,Berthe Morisot,Oil on canvas,Woman at Her Toilette,"Consistent with the Impressionist aesthetic that Berthe Morisot fervently espoused, Woman at Her Toilette attempts to capture the essence of modern life in summary, understated terms. The painting also moves discreetly into the realm of female eroticism explored by Edgar Degas, Édouard Manet, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir but seldom broached at this time by women artists. Rendered with soft, feathery brushstrokes in nuanced shades of lavender, pink, blue, white, and gray, the composition resembles a visual tone poem, orchestrated with such perfumed and rarified motifs as brushed blonde hair, satins, powder puffs, and ﬂower petals. The artist even signed her name along the bottom of the mirror, as if to suggest that the image in her painting is as ephemeral as a silvery reﬂection. Morisot exhibited in seven of the eight Impressionist group shows; this painting was included in the fifth exhibition, in 1880, where her work received great acclaim. She was a particularly close friend of and frequent model for Manet, and she married his younger brother Eugène the year before she completed this painting. In addition to domestic interiors such as this one, Morisot’s pictorial realm included studies of women and children, gardens, fields, and seaside vacation homes.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/11723/woman-at-her-toilette
Fra_13,Claude Monet,Oil on canvas,The Beach at Sainte-Adresse,"In the summer of 1867 Claude Monet stayed with his aunt in Sainte-Adresse, an affluent suburb of the port city of Le Havre in Normandy, where the artist grew up. Monet began the painting outdoors on an overcast day but likely revised the composition in his studio in view of other related canvases, especially the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Regatta at Sainte-Adresse (51.30.4). Technical analysis revealed that what started as a scene of yachts and tourists at the beach ultimately became a view of sailboats and local fishermen. Monet first exhibited this painting at the Impressionist exhibition of 1876, the second of eight independent exhibitions he mounted with a group of like-minded avant-garde artists who sought to present their work outside of France’s traditional, state-sponsored Salon system.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/14598/the-beach-at-sainte-adresse
Fra_14,Robert Delaunay,Oil on canvas,Champs de Mars: The Red Tower,"Robert Delaunay was four years old when the Eiffel Tower was erected in Paris in the public green space known as the Champ de Mars. One of many artists to depict the landmark, Delaunay did a series of Eiffel Tower paintings, of which the Art Institute’s example is among the best known. The artist infused the dynamism of modern life into this image by employing multiple viewpoints, rhythmic fragmentation of form, and strong color contrasts. Delaunay accented the structure’s towering presence by framing it with tall buildings and placing smaller, shorter buildings, seen from above, at its base. The top of the tower seems to soar, its massive structure augmented by winglike clouds and patches of light-filled sky.The artist first showed this painting in the winter of 1912, at the Galerie Barbazanges in Paris, where Guillaume Apollinaire described the work in a review as “unfinished, whether by design or accident.” Although Delaunay’s intent is not recorded, it is certain that by 1923, when this work was illustrated in the pages of the Bulletin de l’effort modern, it looked as it does today: the artist had repainted portions of the canvas and filled areas of reserve with paint.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/9503/champs-de-mars-the-red-tower
Fra_15,Paul Cezanne,Oil on canvas,"The Bay of Marseille, Seen from L’Estaque","In a letter to his friend and teacher Camille Pissarro, Paul Cézanne compared the view of the sea from L’Estaque to a playing card, with its simple shapes and colors. The landscape’s configuration and color fascinated him. This painting is one of more than a dozen such vistas created by the artist during the 1880s. Cézanne divided the canvas into four zones—architecture, water, mountain, and sky. Although these four elements are seen repeatedly in Impressionist paintings, Cézanne’s work is very different from that of his fellow artists. Whereas their primary purpose was to record the transient effects of light, Cézanne was interested in the underlying structure and composition of the views he painted. Filling the canvas with shapes defined by strong, contrasting colors and a complex grid of horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines, he created a highly compact, dynamic pattern of water, sky, land, and village that at once refers back to traditionally structured landscape paintings and looks forward to the innovations of Cubism. Using blocklike brushstrokes to build the space, Cézanne created a composition that seems both two- and three-dimensional. Not locked tightly in place, his forms appear to touch and shift continually, creating a sense of volume and space that strengthens the composition and brings it to life.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16487/the-bay-of-marseille-seen-from-l-estaque
Fra_16,Hilaire Germain Edgar Degas,Pastel over monotype on cream laid paper,Ballet at the Paris Opéra,"One of the nineteenth century’s most innovative artists, Edgar Degas often combined traditional techniques in unorthodox ways. In Ballet at the Paris Opéra, the artist creatively joined the monotype technique, rarely used in his time, with the fragile medium of pastel. Described as “the powder of butterfly wings,” pastel was the perfect medium to illustrate the onstage metamorphosis of spindly young dancers into visions of beauty as perfect and short-lived as butterflies. This work, executed on one of the widest monotype plates ever used by the artist, bears Degas’s characteristically cropped forms and odd vantage points, which effectively convey the immediacy of the scene. The view is from the orchestra pit, with the necks of the double basses intruding into the dancers’ zone. The central dancer is in fifth position, en pointe, but the random placement of the corps de ballet, with the dancers’ free-flowing hair, suggests a rehearsal rather than a performance. The Paris Opéra was the official school of the first state-supported ballet, the Académie Royale de Danse, created in 1661.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/61603/ballet-at-the-paris-opera
Fra_17,Pierre-Auguste Renoir,Oil on canvas,Acrobats at the Cirque Fernando (Francisca and Angelina Wartenberg),"The two little circus girls in this painting are Francisca and Angelina Wartenberg, who performed as acrobats in the famed Cirque Fernando in Paris. Although they were depicted in the center of a circus ring, the sisters actually posed in costume in Pierre-Auguste Renoir’s studio, enabling him to paint them in daylight. Here he portrayed them just as they have finished their act and are taking their bows. One sister turns to the crowd, acknowledging its approval, while the other faces the viewer with an armful of oranges, a rare treat that the audience has tossed in tribute. Although Acrobats at the Cirque Fernando reﬂects the artist’s enchantment with the innocence of childhood—he has enveloped the girls in a virtual halo of pinks, oranges, yellows, and whites—the partially visible, darkly clothed (mainly male) spectators allude to the less wholesome, nocturnal demimonde of the nineteenth-century circus in which these two young performers grew up. The famed Chicago collector Mrs. Potter Palmer purchased Acrobats at the Cirque Fernando in 1892 and was so enamored of the picture that she kept it with her at all times, even on her travels abroad.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/81558/acrobats-at-the-cirque-fernando-francisca-and-angelina-wartenberg
Fra_18,Nicolas Poussin,Oil on canvas,Landscape with Saint John on Patmos,"Although French by birth and training, Nicolas Poussin spent most of his career in Rome, immersed in the study of ancient art, where he painted classically inspired works for an educated elite. His art has long been considered the embodiment of the ideals of seventeenth-century classicism. In this painting, Saint John, one of the four Evangelists who wrote the Gospels of the New Testament, reclines beside his attribute, the eagle. He is here depicted as a powerful old man, presumably after retiring to the Greek island of Patmos to write his gospel and the book of Revelation at the end of his life. To suggest the vanished glory of the ancient world, Poussin carefully constructed an idealized setting for the saint, complete with an obelisk, a temple, and column fragments. Man-made and natural forms were adjusted according to principles of geometry and logic to convey the measured order of the scene. Even the profile view of Saint John is in harmony with the classical landscape. This painting may have been part of a projected series on the four Evangelists—in addition to this work, Poussin completed a companion, Landscape with Saint Matthew (1640; Gemäldegalerie, Berlin).",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/5848/landscape-with-saint-john-on-patmos
Fra_19,Hilaire Germain Edgar Degas,Oil on canvas,The Millinery Shop,"Of at least fifteen pastels, drawings, and paintings that Edgar Degas created on this subject during the 1880s, The Millinery Shop is the largest and perhaps the most ambitious. As a result of its unusual cropping and tilted perspective, it seems to capture an unedited glimpse of the interior of a small nineteenth-century millinery shop. The identity of the young woman in the painting remains unclear: she may be a shop girl or a customer. In an early version of the composition, the woman is clearly intended to be a customer; she wears a fashionable dress, though her hat—a prerequisite token of bourgeois culture—is absent. In the final painting, however, the woman appears with her mouth pursed, as if around a pin, and her hands gloved, possibly to protect the delicate fabric of the hat she holds. Degas seems to have deliberately left her role as a creator or consumer ambiguous. She is totally absorbed in her activity and, like most of the women in Degas’s paintings, seems unaware of being watched. The bonnets that are displayed on the table next to her like a still life present an analogy to the artist’s creative process: where they are unfinished, so too is the painting.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/14572/the-millinery-shop
Fra_20,Constantin Brancusi,"Bronze, stone, and wood",Golden Bird,"Trained in both folk and academic traditions, Constantin Brancusi sought his own path for sculpture around 1907. Breaking with the currents of the time, he adopted direct carving, combined different materials for single works, and simplified form in his search for his subjects’ essential characters. His works have profoundly influenced the development of twentieth-century abstraction.More than any other theme, Brancusi’s series Bird summarizes his quest for a self-sufficient form. “All my life, I have sought to render the essence of flight,” the artist once said. He began the first of twenty-seven Bird sculptures around 1910 and completed the last in the 1940s. He called the earliest variations Maiastra, referring to a bird in Romanian folklore that leads a prince to his princess. In the Art Institute’s Golden Bird, details such as feet, a tail, and an upturned crowing beak are only suggested in an elegant, streamlined silhouette. Brâncusi perched this refined shape on a rough-hewn, geometric base, contrasting the disembodied, light-reflective surface with an earthbound mass. The central polyhedron was cut from the middle of a tree trunk, and its circles (indicating the tree’s age) rotate like a sun, as if radiating light over the bird.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/91194/golden-bird
Fra_21,Gustave Moreau,Oil on canvas,Hercules and the Lernaean Hydra,"Gustave Moreau developed a highly personal vision that combined history, myth, mysticism, and a fascination with the exotic and bizarre. Rooted in the Romantic tradition, Moreau focused on the expression of timeless enigmas of human existence rather than on recording or capturing the realities of the material world.Long fascinated with the myth of Hercules, Moreau gave his fertile imagination free rein in Hercules and the Lernaean Hydra. Looming above an almost primordial ooze of brown paint is the seven-headed Hydra, a serpentine monster whose dead and dying victims lie strewn about a swampy ground. Calm and youthful, Hercules stands amid the carnage, weapon in hand, ready to sever the Hydra’s seventh, “immortal” head, which he will later bury.Despite the violence of the subject, the painting seems eerily still, almost frozen. Reinforcing this mysterious quality is Moreau’s ability to combine suggestive, painterly passages with obsessive detail. The precision of his draftsmanship and the otherworldliness of his palette are the result of his painstaking methods; he executed numerous preliminary studies for every detail in the composition. In contrast to such exactitude, the artist also made bold, colorful watercolors that eschew detail, as exercises to resolve issues of composition and lighting.Moreau seems to have intended this mythological painting to express contemporary political concerns. He was profoundly affected by France’s humiliating military defeat by Prussia in 1870–71. Whether or not Hercules literally personifies France and the Hydra represents Prussia, this monumental work portrays a moral battle between the forces of good and evil, and of light and darkness, with intensity and power.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/20579/hercules-and-the-lernaean-hydra
Fra_22,Matta,Oil on canvas,The Earth Is a Man,"Trained as an architect, the Chilean-born Roberto Matta moved to France in 1933, where he worked in the studio of Le Corbusier. The following year, he met the poet Federico García Lorca in Spain. After Lorca was assassinated by agents of Francisco Franco in 1936, Matta began a screenplay, The Earth Is a Man, which he wrote in tribute to the slain hero. The play’s apocalyptic imagery, rapidly shifting perspectives, and emotionally charged language became the principal source of Matta’s visual art over the next five years. The painting The Earth Is a Man represents the culmination of this project and draws on the artist’s earlier compositions, which he called “Inscapes” or “Psychological Morphologies.” In these, using a technique of psychic automatism developed by the Surrealists, Matta created turbulent forms that serve as visual analogues for states of consciousness.In this powerful, enigmatic work, forces of brilliant light seem to battle those of darkness. The artist spilled, brushed, and wiped on vaporous washes of paint to render the invisible waves of energy that shape and dissolve a molten, primordial terrain. The painting’s visual intensity evokes the tumultuous eruption of a volcano, such as one Matta had witnessed in Mexico in 1941. Exhibited shortly after its completion in New York City, where he had immigrated at the onset of World War II, the mural- size canvas, with its abstract and visionary qualities, enthralled and influenced a new generation of American artists, who would come to be known as the Abstract Expressionists.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/117188/the-earth-is-a-man
Fra_23,Pierre Bonnard,Oil on canvas,Earthly Paradise,"Following a period spent producing Parisian scenes in the style of Édouard Vuillard and Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Pierre Bonnard virtually reinvented his art around 1905. The artist’s new emphasis on large-scale compositions, bold forms, and brilliant colors shows his awareness of the work of his contemporaries Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso, as does his focus on Arcadian landscapes, a theme he had not previously explored. Part of a series of four canvases painted for his dealers, Josse and Gaston Bernheim, between 1916 and 1920, Earthly Paradise demonstrates Bonnard’s new, daring investigations of light, color, and space. Here the artist used foliage to create a proscenium-like arch for a drama involving a brooding Adam and recumbent Eve. The contrast Bonnard established between the figures seems to follow a tradition in which the female, presented as essentially sexual, is connected with nature, while the male, essentially intellectual, is able to transcend the earthly. Heightening the image’s ambiguity is an array of animals, including birds, a monkey, rabbits, and a serpent (here reduced to a garden snake). This less-than-Edenic paradise may reflect the artist’s response to the destruction of Europe during World War I, which was still raging when he began the painting.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/144361/earthly-paradise
Fra_24,Henri Matisse,Oil on canvas,Woman before an Aquarium,"In the first two decades of the 20th century, Henri Matisse visited exhibitions of Islamic art and traveled to Algeria and Morocco, where he collected pottery, textiles, and tiles. Years later while living in Nice, France, Matisse reflected on these experiences, integrating visual elements he encountered, such as the patterned textile screen, into his paintings. In Woman before an Aquarium, the carefully subdued decorative pattern of the screen contributes to the psychologically rich, contemplative mood of this interior scene.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/27984/woman-before-an-aquarium
Fra_25,Georges Braque,Oil on canvas,Little Harbor in Normandy,"In early 1908, Georges Braque began an artistic collaboration with Pablo Picasso. From 1909 until Braque was mobilized for World War I, they worked in creative dialogue, breaking down and reformulating the representation of objects and their structure. In doing so, they pioneered one of the most radical artistic revolutions of the twentieth century, Cubism. Little Harbor in Normandy is the first fully realized example of Braque’s early Cubist style. He described the English Channel coast in severe geometries and a sober palette, reduced in range and intensity to pale shades of color. His compressed treatment of space and use of a shifting perspective seems to propel the two sailboats forward to the front edges of the picture. To further energize the scene, the artist added a fringe of whitecaps to the sea and dashes of clouds across the sky. His repetitive, striated modeling of form, inspired by his study of the art of Paul Cézanne, increased the rigid tension of this canvas. Documentation suggests that Little Harbor in Normandy was exhibited in Paris in March 1909 at the Salon des Indépendants, making this painting the first major Cubist work to be shown in such a prominent venue.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/109330/little-harbor-in-normandy
Fra_26,Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec,Oil on canvas,Equestrienne (At the Cirque Fernando),"This work, set at a circus, captures the tense moment in which a female trick rider prepares to stand up on her horse and leap through a paper hoop held by a clown. The horse gathers speed, spurred on by the whip of famous ringmaster Monsieur Loyal. Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec may have based the garishly made-up rider, dressed in a tutu of gauze and sequins, on Suzanne Valadon, a former circus performer, model, and artist with whom he had a nearly three-year relationship. The rider seems to snarl at Monsieur Loyal, who glares back at her. Toulouse-Lautrec’s setting is the same circus in Montmartre depicted in Pierre-Auguste Renoir’s portrait of the Wartenberg sisters.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16146/equestrienne-at-the-cirque-fernando
Fra_27,Marc Chagall,Oil on canvas,The Praying Jew,"Marc Chagall had a prolific career that spanned more than eight decades of the twentieth century. While his work often exhibits influences of the contemporary movements he encountered in France and Germany, his subjects and decorative lyricism reveal his love of Russian folk art and his roots in Hasidic Judaism.In his 1931 autobiography, My Life, Chagall related how, while visiting Vitebsk (present-day Belarus), the city in which he was born, he realized that the traditions in which he had grown up were fast disappearing and that he needed to document them. He paid a man to pose in his father’s prayer clothes and then painted him, limiting his palette primarily to black and white, as befit the solemnity of the subject. This portrait is noteworthy for the simplicity of its execution; nonetheless, its striking patterns, abstract background, and the slightly distorted features of the model demonstrate Chagall’s absorption of modern trends, especially Cubism.Chagall often painted variants or replicas of works he particularly loved. The Art Institute’s Praying Jew is one of three versions of this composition. He painted the original canvas in 1914, and when he traveled back to Paris in 1923, he took this painting with him. He learned upon his return that much of the work he had left in France had been lost during World War I. This prompted him to make two versions of The Praying Jew before it left his studio: they are the present work and another in the Ca’ Pesaro, Venice; the original is now in the Kunstmuseum, Basel. The later compositions differ from the original only in small details.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/23700/the-praying-jew
Fra_28,Édouard Manet,Oil on canvas,Jesus Mocked by the Soldiers,"For this monumental painting, Édouard Manet depicted Jesus Christ at the end of his life, beaten and awaiting crucifixion. The Roman soldiers force him to don a crown of thorns and proffer a reed “scepter” and purple cloak, all intended to ridicule him as “King of the Jews,” a title bestowed ironically by his tormenters. Manet, who painted very few religious subjects, transformed this sacred narrative into a gritty drama that marries realism with theatricality. Shown without a halo, Jesus glows against the dark background. Is he a holy being emanating divine light or a real man posing under a studio spotlight? The painting caused a scandal in its own time for precisely this ambiguity.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16499/jesus-mocked-by-the-soldiers
Fra_29,Georges Braque,Oil on canvas,Landscape at L’Estaque,"Born into a family of decorative and house painters, Georges Braque once remarked that his decision to become a painter was no more premeditated than his choosing to breathe. After apprenticing in his father’s shop and studying at an art school in his hometown of Le Havre, he went to Paris. In 1905, at the annual Salon d’Automne, he was confronted by the arresting paintings of Henri Matisse and others who had begun to employ vibrant, unmixed colors and energetic, rhythmic brushwork. The unbridled intensity of these works prompted a disapproving critic to call the artists “fauves” (wild beasts). Braque quickly joined the group.Braque painted Landscape at L’Estaque on his first trip to this town on the French Mediterranean coast. He and other young artists were drawn to Provence, in southeastern France, because of its clear light and because of their reverence for the art of Paul Cézanne, who worked in and around the area until his death in 1906. Braque drew upon Cézanne’s use of faceted brushwork, distorted perspectives, and color to structure his compositions for this view down a steep, tree-lined road. Using a palette of highly saturated reds, oranges, and yellows, Braque evoked a sense of turbulent heat, despite the shade provided by the trees. Cézanne’s influence continued to exert itself over Braque in other, critical ways: in early 1908, he would join Pablo Picasso in the development of a revolutionary new style based on the formal construction that constitutes the core of Cézanne’s vision. That style would come to be known as Cubism.—Entry, Master Paintings in the Art Institute of Chicago, 2013, p.102.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/119521/landscape-at-l-estaque
Fra_30,Paul Gauguin,Oil on jute canvas,Arlésiennes (Mistral),"One of seventeen canvases that Paul Gauguin completed during a brief and tumultuous visit with Vincent van Gogh in Arles, this powerful and enigmatic painting depicts the public garden directly across from Van Gogh’s residence, the “Yellow House.” Not only is the careful planning of the composition in marked contrast to the spontaneity seen in Van Gogh’s depiction of the same scene (State Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg), but everything about the painting—its large, ﬂat areas of color; arbitrary handling of space; and enigmatic silhouettes—also exemplifies the deliberateness with which Gauguin sought pictorial harmony and symbolic content in his work. Here four women wrapped in shawls slowly stroll through the garden. The two closest to the viewer avert their gazes and curiously cover their mouths. Their somber outlines echo the two orange cones, which probably represent shrubs wrapped against the frost. The bench along the upper-left path rises steeply, defying logical perspective. Equally puzzling is the mysterious bush on the left, in which Gauguin consciously embedded forms that suggest eyes and a nose, creating the impression of a strange, watchful presence. With its aura of repressed emotion and elusive meaning, Arlésiennes (Mistral) explores the ambiguities, mysteries, and emotions that Gauguin believed underlie appearances.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/19339/arlesiennes-mistral
Fra_31,Henri Matisse,Oil on canvas,Interior at Nice,"Beginning in 1917, Henri Matisse spent most winters in Nice, on the Mediterranean coast. He often stayed at the Hôtel Mediterranée, a Rococo-style building he later fondly termed “faked, absurd, delicious!” Interior at Nice is perhaps the most ambitious of a series of images the painter created using the hotel as a backdrop. The pink-tiled floors and yellow, arabesque-patterned wall-paper are present in many of these works, as are the skirted dressing table, oval mirror, shuttered French window, and balcony. The balcony in fact was one of the artist’s favorite themes, allowing him to link internal and external space into a continuum structured by patterns and modulated light.Additionally, Matisse often included a young woman somewhere in the scene. Here, his favorite model at the time, Antoinette Arnoux, plays an important role. Not only is she the subject of the painting on the wall, but the composition’s high viewpoint and plunging, wide-angled perspective draw all attention to her as she sits on the balcony, her back to the sea. Framed by shimmering curtains, she gazes directly at the viewer.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/2816/interior-at-nice
Fra_32,Jean Baptiste Camille Corot,Oil on canvas mounted on board,Interrupted Reading,"Interrupted Reading is among the most compelling of Camille Corot’s late figure paintings. Corot almost never exhibited these studies of the human form, preferring instead to publicize the idyllic landscapes that were his specialty. To emphasize the private nature of Interrupted Reading, Corot enclosed his model within the protective environment of the artist’s studio. The mood of the painting is introspective and somewhat melancholic, the very essence of the Romantic sensibility. The muse-like image of a woman reading a book was a popular one in nineteenth-century art, but Corot chose to show his model pausing, looking up from this activity. Having spent a number of years in Italy and being a lover of everything Italian, the artist often furnished his models with Italianate costumes such as the one worn here. Whereas Corot’s subject matter is traditional, his technique is not. With direct and bold brushwork, he explored the human form as a construction of masses that support and balance one another. This broad handling is complemented by the artist’s obvious delight in detail—the ribbon in the model’s hair, the delicate earrings, the deep folds in the skirt. Here he combined a profound sense of formal structure with the dreamy softness and intimacy that characterize his most famous landscapes.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/81512/interrupted-reading
Fra_33,Édouard Manet,Oil on canvas,Fish (Still Life),"Although still-life ensembles were an important element in many of the major paintings of the avant-garde artist Édouard Manet, his most sustained interest in the genre itself was from 1864 to 1865, when Fish was painted. Manet’s focus on still lifes coincided with the gradual reacceptance of the genre during the nineteenth century, due in part to the growth of the middle class, whose tastes ran to intimate, moderately priced works. This painting, like many of Manet’s still-life compositions, recalls seventeenth-century Dutch models. The directness of execution, bold brushwork, and immediacy of vision displayed in the canvas, however, suggest why the public found Manet’s work so unorthodox and confrontational. While Fish is indeed an image of “dead nature” (nature morte is the French term for still life), there is nothing still about the work: the produce seems fresh and the handling of paint vigorous. Further enliven-ing the composition is the placement of the carp, which offsets the strong diagonal of the other elements. Manet never submitted his still lifes to the official French Salon but rather sold them through the burgeoning network of art galleries in Paris and gave them to friends.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/44892/fish-still-life
Fra_34,Francis Picabia,Oil on canvas,Edtaonisl (Ecclesiastic),"In 1911 Francis Picabia met Marcel Duchamp, who had devised a unique style of painting that combined Cubist elements with pseudodiagrams in humorous compositions. Stimulated by Duchamp’s example, Picabia pioneered a new, colorful, and intellectual visual language, of which Edtaonisl is a prime example.This picture relates to Picabia’s experience aboard a transatlantic ship in 1913, on his way to the opening of the Armory Show, North America’s first major exhibition of modern art. Picabia was amused by two fellow passengers—a Polish dancer named Stacia Napierskowska and a Dominican priest who could not resist the temptation of watching her rehearse with her troupe. While the tumultuous shapes in this work suggest fragments of bodies and nautical architecture, the depiction of specific forms is less important than the effective expression of contrast and rocking motion, which evokes the sensations of dance and a ship moving through rolling seas. On the top right of the canvas, Picabia painted the word Edtaonisl—an acronym made by alternating the letters of the French words étoile (star) and dans[e] (dance), a process analogous to the artist’s shattering and recombining of forms. He subtitled the work Ecclesiastic, hinting at the juxtaposition of the spiritual and the sensual.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/80062/edtaonisl-ecclesiastic
Fra_35,Fernand Léger,Oil on canvas,Reclining Woman,"Fernand Léger first saw the work of the Cubists Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso at the Paris gallery of Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler. Around 1909 Léger began to experiment with geometric shapes, complementary colors, and strong outlines, although his paintings remained largely nonrepresentational until after World War I. His involvement in the war had a profound impact on his work. In the years following, he introduced volumetric forms that resembled pistons and pipes into his compositions, joining others in the Parisian vanguard in charting a more sober, conservative course that placed renewed emphasis on objective observation. Substituting hard metallic tubes for pliant flesh and flat patterned disks for soft and dense pillows, the artist updated the classical figure of the odalisque (a female slave or concubine often pictured in the history of art as a reclining nude) with his particular blend of Cubism and machine aesthetics. Reclining Woman demonstrates Léger’s interest in producing “everyday poetic images”: paintings in which the manufactured object is the “principal personage,” shown as precisely as possible to reveal an absolute sculptural value rather than sentimental associations. This work exemplifies the Purist style, a kind of industrial classicism that focused on utilitarian objects. Léger hoped that through such paintings, art would become accessible to the whole of modern society rather than to just a privileged few.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/153701/reclining-woman
Fra_36,Paul Cezanne,Oil on canvas,Madame Cezanne in a Yellow Chair,"This portrait is one in a series of four Paul Cezanne made of his wife, Emélie-Hortense Fiquet, whom he met when she worked as an artist’s model. They had a son together in 1872 and married in 1886. Technical examination suggests that Cezanne traced this image, the second in the series, from the first portrait, which he made from life. In contrast to her masklike expression, Hortense’s hands are agitated, contorted by crisscrossing brushstrokes and the dark-blue outlines Cezanne used to sketch out the forms, which remain visible in the final work.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/62371/madame-cezanne-in-a-yellow-chair
Fra_37,Odilon Redon,"Pastel, with touches of stumping, incising, and brushwork, on blue-gray wove paper with multi-colored fibers altered to tan, perimeter mounted to cardboard",Flower Clouds,"The evocative, symbolic art of Odilon Redon drew its inspiration from the internal world of his imagination. For years this student of Rodolphe Bresdin worked only in black and white, producing powerful and haunting charcoal drawings, lithographs, and etchings. Just as these black works, or Noirs, began to receive critical and public acclaim in the 1890s, Redon discovered the marvels of color through the use of pastel. His immersion in color and this new technique brought about a change in the artist’s approach to his subject matter as well. Flower Clouds is one of a number of pastels executed around 1905 that are dominated by spiritual overtones. Here a sailboat bears two figures, perhaps two saintly women, on a timeless journey through a fantastic, phosphorescent sea and sky. The dreamlike skiff may reflect Redon’s internal voyage, replacing the nocturnal turmoil of the earlier Noirs with a more hopeful vision. The luminous intensity of the pastels echoes the ardent spirituality of the theme.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/76395/flower-clouds
Fra_38,Hubert Robert,Oil on canvas,The Fountains,"The painting of Classical ruins had reached the zenith of its popularity when Hubert Robert, the leading French practitioner of this specialty, was commissioned in 1787 to paint a suite of four canvases for a wealthy financier’s château at Méréville, near Paris. The Fountains and its companion pieces were set into the paneled walls of a salon in the château, creating an alternate space that played off of the elegant, Neoclassical decor of the room. Robert has studied in Rome from 1754 to 1765 and there had gleaned his artistic vocabulary. Like the other three large paintings from the group painted for Méréville, all in the Art Institute, The Fountains exploits Robert’s typical vocabulary of fictive niches, arches, coffered vaults, colonnades, majestic stairwells, and Roman statuary to create a fantasy of expansive space. The four paintings are inhabited by tiny figures in the foreground; these serve only to set the scale and animate the scene, for the ruins themselves are the true subject of the pictures. In his use of ruins, Robert embodied the notion of the relationship of mankind and the built environment to nature that was expressed by the French philosopher and encyclopedist Denis Diderot: “Everything vanishes, everything dies, only time endures.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/57051/the-fountains
Fra_39,Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres,Oil on canvas,"Amédée-David, the Comte de Pastoret","This portrait by French painter Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres depicts the young count Amédée-David de Pastoret at 32 years old. One of several paintings he commissioned from Ingres, this portrait highlights the nobleman’s status and swagger. Posing confidently in his finest garments and wearing a medal of the Order of the Legion of Honor, he gazes directly at the viewer with a stern expression. Light glints off his gold ring and accentuates the exquisite detail of his sword’s hilt. Ingres enhanced the sumptuous elegance of this scene through elongated forms and skillful application of color, setting Amédée-David’s peachy flesh against a forest-green satin wall and curtain.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/111317/amedee-david-the-comte-de-pastoret
Fra_40,Édouard Manet,Oil on canvas,Woman Reading,"During the late nineteenth century, Parisian cafés were the gathering places of artists and writers and were ideal locations for observing the urban scene. Many Impressionist paintings depict the Café Nouvelle-Athènes on the rue Pigalle, where two tables were reserved for Édouard Manet and his circle—a group that included the painters Edgar Degas, Claude Monet, Camille Pissarro, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir, and the writers Charles Baudelaire and Émile Zola.At first glance, this fashionably dressed young woman appears to have been captured sitting at a favorite café: the marble tabletop, beer mug, and magazine attached to a wooden bar suggest such a setting, and her heavy clothing and kid gloves indicate that she is at an outdoor table and that the weather is cool. However, the floral background is actually one of Manet’s paintings and the café a re-creation in his studio.Woman Reading is one of the most Impressionist of Manet’s images; the quick, free brushstrokes and light colors are characteristic of his technique late in his career. Painted only a few years before his death, this work admirably captures a fleeting moment, the sense of modern life that Manet and his contemporaries sought to represent.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/14591/woman-reading
Fra_41,"Jean Hey, (the Master of Moulins)",Oil on panel,The Annunciation,"The archangel Gabriel’s announcement to Mary that she will give birth to a son, and her immediate acceptance of this news, represent the moment of Christ’s Incarnation. Although The Annunciation appears to be an independent painting, it is actually a fragment that once formed the right side of an altarpiece; the left side, now in the National Gallery, London, depicts the moment of Mary’s own Immaculate Conception, believed to have occurred when her parents, Joachim and Anne, greeted each other at the Golden Gate. A central section, now lost, probably featured the enthroned Virgin and Child, perhaps with Saint Anne. Jean Hey, known as the Master of Moulins,was the leading painter working in France in the last decades of the fifteenth century. He worked in Moulins in central France for Duke Pierre II of Bourbon and his wife, Anne of France, who played a large role in the government of of the kingdom during the minority of Anne’s brother Charles VIII. As their court painter, Hey, who was probably of Netherlandish origin, fused the intense naturalism and preciousness of Flemish and French painting and manuscript illumination with the emerging Renais-sance interest in antiquity, as is evident in this painting’s Italianate architecture.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16327/the-annunciation
Fra_42,Paul Gauguin,Oil on jute canvas,Merahi metua no Tehamana (Tehamana Has Many Parents or The Ancestors of Tehamana),"In this portrait, the 13-year-old Tahitian girl named Tehamana appears stoic, shoulders squared and gaze unflinching. She wears a missionary dress and wields a Samoan fan as white flowers tumble from her hair. The ripe mango beside her alludes to fertility. In the background, Gauguin combined various non-European emblems—glyphs derived from an Easter Island tablet and a female deity inspired by Polynesian and Hindu sources—to build a generic sense of foreigness and mystery, transforming Tehamana into the embodiment of his own desire.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/60812/merahi-metua-no-tehamana-tehamana-has-many-parents-or-the-ancestors-of-tehamana
Fra_43,Jacques Louis David,Oil on canvas,Madame de Pastoret and Her Son,"The volatile events of the early years of the French Revolution make it impossible to determine with certainty the date of Jacques-Louis David’s warm, fresh portrait of Adélaïde de Pastoret. They also probably account for the portrait’s unfinished state. David, a renowned Neoclassical painter, was at the time an ardent revolutionary; Madame de Pastoret was the wife of a staunch royalist. The sittings must have occurred after the birth, early in 1791, of her son, who is portrayed asleep by her side, and before her brief imprisonment during the Reign of Terror in 1792. Here David completed the stippled, almost monochromatic underpainting but did not create the stark, enamel-smooth surface that is characteristic of his finished paintings. He did not even get far enough to place a needle and thread in Madame de Pastoret’s hand. Nevertheless, this large portrait of unaffected domesticity captures the youthful mother with charm as well as dignity and displays David’s skill as a portraitist. Objecting to David’s revolutionary ideals, Madame de Pastoret (who became the Marquise de Pastoret in 1817) refused the painting during the artist’s lifetime. After David’s death, she had her son, by then an adult, purchase the portrait from the artist’s estate.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/27307/madame-de-pastoret-and-her-son
Fra_44,Hilaire Germain Edgar Degas,Oil on canvas,Henri Degas and His Niece Lucie Degas (The Artist’s Uncle and Cousin),"Edgar Degas was the most subtle portrait painter in the Impressionist group. His portraits, mostly of family members and close friends, were executed primarily in the period from the late 1850s through the 1870s. During frequent visits to Florence and Naples, Degas recorded his Italian relatives with great candor. On one of his last trips to Naples, in the mid-1870s, Degas painted this double portrait of his orphaned first cousin, Lucie, and their uncle Henri, in whose care the girl had recently been placed. In this painting, Degas showed two people, separated by many years in age, who are tentatively accepting the circumstances of their new relationship. Degas, having recently lost his own father and having witnessed other family misfortunes, addressed subjects such as this with awareness and sensitivity.Areas of thin paint and unresolved details suggest that the painting was never completed. But the spare treatment of the background effectively emphasizes the heads and upper portions of the figures. Their connection is expressed in the similar tilt of their heads and in the black mourning clothes they both wear. Their psychological discomfort is suggested by the contrast of the plain wall behind Lucie and the darker glass-and-wood French door behind Henri, as well as by the curved chair back against which the man sits and on which the girl leans. At once intimate and distant, casual and guarded, these two relatives, and the third relation who paints them from the other side of the paper-laden table, poignantly express the fragility and necessity of family ties.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/14574/henri-degas-and-his-niece-lucie-degas-the-artist-s-uncle-and-cousin

Fra_46,Auguste Rodin,Bronze with dark brown patina,Adam,"Auguste Rodin’s powerfully expressive figure of Adam was originally intended to be paired with a sculpture of Eve, flanking a sculptured bronze portal commissioned by the French government for the Musée de Arts Décoratifs, Paris. For this monumental undertaking, which he entitled The Gates of Hell, Rodin turned to past Italian masters. Michelangelo’s Creation of Adam fresco on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel in Rome (1508–12) inspired the pose of Rodin’s subject. Rodin rotated Michelangelo’s reclining Adam and transferred the frescoed figure’s gesture of receiving life from God to the sculpture’s right arm. The exaggerated turn of Adam’s left arm comes from Michelangelo’s sculpture of the dead Christ in his Pietà (1548–55; Museo del Duomo, Florence). Rodin chose the portal’s theme from Dante’s fourteenth-century epic poem Inferno; here Adam’s agonized body strikingly conveys the sufferings caused by original sin. Although the museum building was never constructed and the portal was not completed as originally conceived, Rodin explored the expressive potential of the human body as few artists before him had dared. As independent statues, Adam and Eve are among the commission’s numerous progeny. Not until 1938 was the gate cast in bronze and placed at the entrance to the grounds of the Musée Rodin, Paris.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/11320/adam
Fra_47,Fernand Léger,Oil on canvas,The Railway Crossing (Sketch),"Fernand Léger first saw the work of Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso at the Paris gallery of Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler. Around 1909 Léger began to paint in a Cubist style, although his compositions in this mode are more colorful and curvilinear than works by Braque and Picasso of the same period, with their angular forms and subdued tones. An artist with far-ranging interests and talents, Léger later became a designer for theater, opera, and ballet, as well as a book illustrator, filmmaker, muralist, ceramist, and teacher.Typically, Léger would develop a major composition by preparing studies in a variety of media. The Railway Crossing is an oil study for The Level Crossing (1919; private collection, Basel, Switzerland). When he took up this subject in 1919, he made a number of drawings and oil sketches, including the present work. Like many of his contemporaries, Léger was fascinated by the machine age. He maintained that machines and industrial objects were as important to his art as figures. References to such elements pervade The Railway Crossing. In the midst of a complex scaffolding of cylinders and beams, an arrow appears on a brightly outlined signboard. A network of solid volumes and flat forms seems to circulate within the shallow space, just as pistons move within a motor. The precise definition of his forms and the brilliance of his palette express Léger’s belief that the machine, along with the age it created, was one of the triumphs of modern civilization.— Entry, Master Paintings in the Art Institute of Chicago, 2013, p. 118.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/79600/the-railway-crossing-sketch
Fra_48,Eugène Delacroix,Oil on canvas,The Combat of the Giaour and Hassan,"This colorful scene was inspired by a poem from Lord Byron’s “Oriental tales,” a popular series of romances. Both the poem and the painting are examples of 19th-century Europeans’ interest in fantastical and often violent depictions of Middle Eastern, North African, and Asian cultures, which reinforced colonialist aims. Although Eugène Delacroix did not visit North Africa until 1832, he began painting Orientalist subjects early on in his career. The artist’s French audience would have been receptive to his choice of jewel-like colors to describe the shimmering, gold-braided vest and billowing robes of the central figures. Far from accurately representing the attire of the 17th-century combatants of Byron’s poem, Delacroix drew upon styles worn by the Turko-Egyptian Mameluke warriors during Napoleon Bonaparte’s military campaign in Egypt in 1798–99.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/110663/the-combat-of-the-giaour-and-hassan
Fra_49,Henri Cartier-Bresson,Gelatin silver print,"Hyères, France","In Hyères, France, Henri Cartier-Bresson captured the instant when an ever-moving image—in this case, a bicyclist streaking by an iron railing—achieves a timeless harmony of form, expression, and content. An early work, taken before Cartier-Bresson was a professional photographer, this picture of the world in flux shows spontaneity, intuition, and a Surrealist whimsy. Cartier-Bresson’s keen sense of composition derived, in part, from his training as a painter, as well as an acknowledged indebtedness to André Kertész. Both photographers used a miniature Leica camera, which allowed for thirty-six exposures in quick succession and, because of its compact serviceability, acted as a true extension of the eye. So definite was Cartier-Bresson’s rapid-fire release of the shutter that he used the entire negative of the final print, unretouched and unmanipulated. This remarkable capacity to seize life’s calculated and coincidental ambiguities explains why his is one of the most influential visions of the twentieth century. In addition to his later celebrated photojournalistic works, Cartier-Bresson produced two films, published more than a dozen books, and in 1947 helped establish the collaborative photography agency Magnum.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/50148/hyeres-france
Fra_50,,Limestone,Head of an Apostle,"This imposing head probably comes from a full-length sculpture of an apostle that was one of the column or jamb figures flanking the portals of the west facade of Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris. Showing the heritage of ancient and Byzantine models, it bears all the stylistic hallmarks of the beginning of the Gothic style in the region around the year 1200. The object’s origin was the subject of heated scholarly debate for several decades. Neutron activation analysis has shown that the limestone came from a quarry that also supplied stone for other carvings on Notre-Dame. The discovery of sculptural fragments from the cathedral’s Gallery of Kings above the west portals, dated to between 1220 and 1235 (and now in the Musée National du Moyen Âge, Paris), provided an important point of comparison. The Art Institute’s head is said to have been found during excavations for the modernization of Paris in the mid-nineteenth century. Medieval sculpture from Notre-Dame was purposefully damaged in the 1790s during the French Revolution because of its presumed royal associations. Fragments of some of the sculpture removed at the order of the revolutionary tribunal were buried out of a lingering respect for its tradition and quality, to be rediscovered in later years.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/50909/head-of-an-apostle
Fra_51,Henri Matisse,Oil on canvas,Still Life with Geranium,"Like his artistic hero, Paul Cezanne, Henri Matisse merged the traditional and the avant-garde. In Still Life with Geranium, he transformed a simple still life into a populated Arcadian landscape painting, rendered in the brilliant color, thick paint, and rapid brushwork characteristic of the group of painters known as the Fauves (French for “wild beasts”). Matisse was recognized by critics as the leader of this group.This composition is one of contrasts—the pale palette and light brushwork in the upper half of the picture are juxtaposed with the darker colored, heavily painted lower half; the firmly planted pose of the female figure is contraposed with the almost-ﬂeeing figure of the male; and the red vegetables grown near Paris are set near ceramic objects from exotic, faraway places. One of many still-life paintings in which Matisse incorporated his own figurative sculptures, here the artist challenged his viewers’ expectations by rendering his modeled figures with minimal color and simple lines. Probably represented as plaster casts, these figures would later be made in bronze editions by the artist; versions of Woman Leaning on Her Hands (on the right of the geranium) and Thorn Extractor (on the left) are also in the collection of the Art Institute.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/87045/still-life-with-geranium
Fra_52,Claude Lorrain,Oil on canvas,View of Delphi with a Procession,"This painting of the ancient city of Delphi (in what is now Greece) presents a delicate rendering of the glowing Mediterranean atmosphere. Like many other foreign artists drawn to the ruins of antiquity, French painter Claude Lorrain was fascinated with the ancient Roman Empire. Here, he evoked a serene, bucolic world akin to the poetic vision of the ancient Roman writer Virgil, depicting the ruins restored to their original glory as Claude imagined. This painting was commissioned by Cardinal Carlo Camillo Massimi, an important and erudite collector in Rome.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/43145/view-of-delphi-with-a-procession
Fra_53,Gustave Courbet,Oil on canvas,Mère Grégoire,"As the undisputed leader of the Realist movement, Gustave Courbet played a crucial role in the development of modern French painting. But critics and the public did not easily accept his large, naturalistic, and unsentimental depictions of commonplace, often rural subjects; they called him the “apostle of ugliness.”The ample, demurely dressed subject of Mère Grégoire was inspired by the heroine of a popular song written in the 1820s by French lyricist Pierre-Jean Béranger. Béranger often penned ribald lyrics; his “Madame Grégoire” was the proprietor of a house of prostitution. Courbet depicted the woman here in the midst of a transaction, with coins scattered on a marble-topped counter and a ledger beneath her right hand. Under her other hand is the small bell she uses to summon one of her female employees. She presumably offers an unseen customer a flower, a symbol of love.The painting may also have had a political subtext. Béranger and Courbet were fierce opponents of the monarchy and the Second Empire, respectively. In the mid-1850s, when Courbet began his portrait of Mère Grégoire, the government harshly attacked the songs of the popular writer as part of an effort to restrict free expression. Courbet’s decision to portray Béranger’s Madame Grégoire, whose flower exhibits the blue, white, and red of the French flag, may represent a protest not only against government censorship but also against the Second Empire itself, making the subject of this painting into a heroine embodying the rights to freedom in life and love that were forbidden under a repressive regime.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/4428/mere-gregoire
Fra_54,Jean Honoré Fragonard,Oil on canvas,Portrait of a Man in Costume,"Jean-Honoré Fragonard is perhaps best known for his light-hearted, amorous subjects, which seem to embody the spirit of eighteenth-century France. This work, painted in lively brushstrokes, represents another important aspect of Fragonard’s genius—in a series of fantasy portraits, he used references to earlier artists to enliven his own characterizations of his patrons and artistic friends. Here the identity of the sitter is unknown; however, the half-length format, the rapid, virtuoso handling of the paint, and the use of seventeenth-century costume link this work to the fantasy portraits. In this instance, Fragonard took as his starting point a painting of an actor by the Italian Baroque artist Domenico Fetti, then in a leading Parisian collection; in other related portraits, the French painter was inspired by the bravura style of the Flemish artists Peter Paul Rubens and Anthony van Dyck. Two paintings from this series bear inscriptions stating that they were painted in one hour. Whether or not this is literally true, the direct, personal quality that results from Fragonard’s command of the medium makes this series particularly appealing to a modern sensibility.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/93900/portrait-of-a-man-in-costume
Fra_55,Wou-Ki Zao,Oil on linen,The Night is Stirring (La nuit remue),"Born in Beijing, Zao Wou-ki moved to Paris in 1948. He had studied at China’s most progressive art academy, training in both Western oil painting and Chinese ink painting and calligraphy. Despite his education, Zao’s arrival in the cosmopolitan French capital prompted for him a more tangible, as well as conceptual, reckoning with Eastern and Western aesthetics. However, it was not until he traveled to the United States, where he viewed Abstract Expressionist paintings for the first time, did the artist embrace exclusively the atmospheric abstraction for which he became known. After returning to Paris, Zao began to create sweeping, large-scale compositions and swiftly rose to prominence among a circle of fellow Paris-based abstract painters interested in lyrical and intuitive mark making, including American Joan Mitchell and German-born Hans Hartung.In The Night is Stirring, Zao built up layers of jewel-toned color, activated by touches of lurid red and a torquing column that seems to climb up the center of the canvas. While his dark, inky brushstrokes call to mind Chinese calligraphy, still more traditional Chinese painting is reflected through Zao’s manipulation of the tropes of the landscape format, which emphasizes the rhythmsand energies of nature more than a strictly realistic approach. Suspended between the conventions of Chinese landscape painting and the materiality of Western oil painting, Zao’s canvas occupies other in-between states as well; it is, for example, an abstract work that suggests not only landscape in general but nightfall more specifically. Zhang borrowed the title from a book of poems by writer and painter Henri Michaux, a close friend and mentor.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/15563/the-night-is-stirring-la-nuit-remue
Fra_56,Jean Baptiste Siméon Chardin,"Pastel on blue laid paper, mounted on canvas",Self-Portrait with a Visor,"Over a century after its creation, the French novelist Marcel Proust said of Jean-Siméon Chardin’s audacious self-portrait, “This old oddity is so intelligent, so crazy … above all, so much of an artist.” In a fitting finale to a long, successful career as a painter of still lifes and genre scenes, Chardin turned in his last decade to a new medium, pastel, and to a new subject matter, portraits (primarily self-portraits). Eye problems arising from lead-based oil paint poisoning were the partial cause of this dramatic change. Of his thirteen extant pastel self-portraits, the most famous are versions of the example seen here, with the casually dressed, aging artist in his studio. A virtuoso colorist, the septuagenarian here revealed a joyously free stroke and palette. Nonetheless, the construction of the figure is solid and rigorous, adding to his powerful presence. This composition was created at the same time as a portrait of the artist’s wife for the 1775 Salon (Musée du Louvre, Paris). A year later, Chardin—with greater daring—replicated the pair. These later portraits were separated for almost two hundred years, until they were reunited in the collection of the Art Institute.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/102131/self-portrait-with-a-visor
Fra_57,Émilie Charmy,Oil on canvas,L’Estaque,"Émilie Charmy was among the first women to exhibit paintings in the Fauvist style. Traveling to rugged sites on France’s Mediterranean coast, such as L’Estaque, depicted here, she created landscapes suffused with emotion and subjective expression. Laying down vibrant color in broad unstructured planes, she composed the scene as a collection of loosely joined organic forms. The swelling and tapering shapes along the composition’s edges produce a dynamic sense of movement that dissipates at the center, where we glimpse the calm waters of the Bay of Marseille.Charmy was celebrated during her lifetime, but the accolades she received feel wildly gendered today. In 1921, for example, a French writer described her as an artist who “sees like a woman and paints like a man…from the one she takes grace and from the other strength, and this is what makes her such a strange and powerful painter who holds our attention.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/9010/l-estaque
Fra_58,André Charles Boulle,"Oak, tortoiseshell, brass, pewter, ebony, and gilt-bronze mounts",Coffer,"The cabinetmaker André-Charles Boulle was responsible for some of the finest examples of French furniture made during the reign of Louis XIV (1643–1715). Boulle perfected the technique of veneering furniture with a rich marquetry of tortoiseshell, pewter, and gilt copper, and he further enriched his surfaces with sculptural gilt bronze mounts. Acclaimed for his brilliant designs and superb execution, Boulle was commis- sioned by the most discerning and demanding patrons in France, among them members of the royal family, aristocrats, ministers, and financiers.This rectangular coffer is a visually powerful example of Boulle’s work from the early eighteenth century. Such objects served as containers for medals or jewels. This example is richly veneered with marquetry panels of scrolls, strapwork, and vines executed in engraved gilt copper on a ground of tortoiseshell. Framing the panels are strips of ebony and pewter. The coffer also features gilt bronze mounts in the form of male, female, and animal heads. The escutcheon in the center of the front panel may depict the head of Apollo, his long hair braided on either side of his face and gathered in a knot below his chin. The lid contains a grinning, bearded male face, perhaps that of a satyr, crowned with a radiating headdress, the whole of which supports a handle.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/156442/coffer
Fra_59,Henri Matisse,Bronze,Seated Nude,"While Henri Matisse is perhaps best known as a painter, his simultaneous work in other media—drawing, printmaking, and especially sculpting—was rooted in his earliest artistic experiences and training. In fact, more than half of Matisse’s total output of sculpture (over eighty works) dates to between 1900 and 1909. His three-dimensional pieces reveal a deep interest in the human figure, and in particular the female nude, as well as ancient and Old Master works of art.Although Matisse’s sculptural production declined after World War I, the works he made while living in Nice continue his earlier interests and relate to his new paintings of odalisques. Seated Nude was inspired by Michelangelo’s Night, a copy of which Matisse studied at the École des Arts Décoratifs in Nice. The artist worked on the sculpture for almost a decade and extended his exploration of the figure’s pose in numerous drawings and lithographs, at least three paintings, and another sculpture. Over time he slowly increased the size of the figure, making it one of the largest freestanding sculptures in his oeuvre. With its dynamic, cantilevered pose, sharply faceted limbs, and monumental scale, Seated Nude is a study in contrasts, of repose, vitality, and even tension.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/7124/seated-nude
Fra_60,Eugène Delacroix,"Black and red chalk, with pastel, heightened with white chalk, over wash, on tan wove paper",Crouching Woman,"Crouching Woman is one of five pastel studies for Eugène Delacroix’s monumental painting The Death of Sardanapalus (1827; Musée du Louvre, Paris), which helped establish his reputation as the leader of the French Romantic movement. Of the few pastels that Delacroix produced, this is the only group that can be related to a single painting. Inspired by an 1821 play by the English Romantic poet Lord Byron, the canvas dramatically depicts the last king of the Assyrians. Reclining on his bed moments before his own suicide, the king gazes passively at his wives, concubines, and livestock as they are slain by his order to prevent their slaughter by the enemy army that has just defeated them. In this expressive image of one of the concubines, Delacroix convincingly captured the horror of the moment. With a sure, sweeping line, he described the rhythmic, taut posture of a figure recoiling from a blow or the stab of a knife. Although this powerful figure is significantly truncated in the final painting, the pastel provides insight into Delacroix’s creative process, and its sensual drama is representative of the Romantic period.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/76779/crouching-woman
Fra_61,Jean Pierre Latz (Cabinetmaker),"Oak, tortoiseshell, kingwood, brass, gilt bronze, and glass",Wall Clock,"An exuberant and lavish example of the French Rococo style, this sculptural wall clock epitomizes the extravagant era of Louis XV (r. 1715–74). Festooned with ormolu (gilt bronze) swirls and floral swags, the clock required the collaboration of numerous specialized artisans. Its case, candelabra, and wall bracket were created by the eminent Jean-Pierre Latz, who was appointed ébéniste (furniture maker) to the king in 1741. The clock’s eight-day movement was manufactured in the Flemish city of Ghent by Francis Bayley, possibly a member of the large London dynasty of clockmakers of that name. Opulent clocks such as this did more than tell time; they delighted the ear with music (six melody titles are engraved in the dial’s arch) and dazzled the eye with dramatic scenes. Here the Greek god Apollo is poised at the top of the clock case to slay the serpent Python. The space between the clock and the wall bracket was cleverly used to suggest the beast’s home, the cave of Mount Parnassus in Greece. In the triangular base are the faces of Zeus, symbolizing time, and Hera, presiding over marriage and childbirth. They are surmounted by two small coats of arms belonging to the Flemish bride and groom whose union the clock was probably created to celebrate.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/57819/wall-clock
Fra_62,Jean Honoré Fragonard,"Brush and brown ink and brush and brown wash, with graphite, on ivory laid paper","The Letter, or The Spanish Conversation","Jean-Honoré Fragonard’s highly personal, powerful style emerged after periods of study with both François Boucher and Jean-Siméon Chardin, and over five years at the Académie de France in Rome. Entitled The Letter, or The Spanish Conversation (because of the man’s elegant attire—with a doublet of full sleeves and a wide, stiff neck ruff—a costume that was “in the Spanish mode”), this lively sheet depicts with wit and teasing ambiguity an intimate incident in an upper-class drawing room. The artist’s rapid, virtuoso draftsmanship evokes forms with what seems like a minimum of effort, and his powerful handling of brush and wash reflects his ability to capture the effects of light. The interplay between the drawing’s broad, free underdrawing and its shimmering veils of wash lend this work its charm and vivacity. The woman in this drawing is said to be Fragonard’s sister-in-law, the artist Marguerite Gérard.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/52736/the-letter-or-the-spanish-conversation
Fra_63,Jean Antoine Watteau,Red and black chalk on cream laid paper,The Old Savoyard,"The Flemish-born artist Jean-Antoine Watteau deviated from his acclaimed scenes of courtly figures in park-like settings (called fêtes galantes) with this arresting and naturalistic chalk drawing of a humble Savoyard. This elderly vagabond from the Savoy region of France was one of many peasants who, around the turn of the eighteenth century, flocked to Paris, where they tried to eke out livings as chimney sweeps, scavengers, or street entertainers. This old entertainer’s props accompany him: a large box of curiosities is on his back, and under his arm is a smaller case probably containing his constant companion and coperformer, a furry marmot. Using only two colors of chalk, Watteau depicted the Savoyard’s shrewd, humorous face, his tattered clothing, and his bulky paraphernalia with remarkable precision, sensitivity, and humanity. Of the ten extant studies of Savoyards by Watteau, four appear to portray the same salty character seen here. The drawing’s broad, free execution points to the accomplished late works of this gifted artist.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/20432/the-old-savoyard
Fra_64,Claude Lorrain,"Pen and brown ink with brush and brown wash, heightened with white gouache and traces of white chalk, over black chalk and graphite, on cream laid paper",Panorama from the Sasso,"For Claude Lorrain, one of the most important aspects of his adopted city of Rome was its surrounding countryside, the Campagna, which the artist studied, sketched, and painted all his life. His evocative classical landscapes were sought after by papal patrons as well as by aristocrats and royalty throughout Europe. For nearly a century after his death, travelers on the grand tour of European capitals judged real scenery according to his standards. In Claude’s landscapes, as in this superb drawing, order and tranquility prevail; men perform no labor but rather exist peacefully in beautiful pastoral settings blessed by the warm Roman light. Depicted here is the region around the Sasso, a large rock ten miles south of Civitavecchia, Rome’s modern seaport. Evidently made at the site of the rock itself, the drawing is remarkable in its mastery of subtle ink washes that evocatively suggest, rather than describe, the landscape and sea. Individual trees stand out as nearly geometric forms against the unifying light. The drawing’s horizontal format enhances the idyllic landscape’s panoramic sweep, which the viewer savors along with the solitary shepherd.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/60031/panorama-from-the-sasso
Fra_65,"Brassaï, (Gyula Halász)",Gelatin silver print,Untitled,"From the moment of his arrival in Paris in 1924, Brassaï (who took his name from Brasov, his Transylvanian birthplace) was fascinated by the city “under cover of darkness.” Around 1930, when the former art student learned from his friend André Kertész that photography at night was indeed possible, he began documenting this extraordinary underworld. The result was his remarkable publication Paris at Night (first published in France in 1933), which depicts not only such well-known spots as the Arc de Triomphe, but also dark streets and alleys with just enough light to reveal a flower-shop window, a pissoir, a show at the Folies-Bergère, or the details of wet paving bricks. This image is from a 1932 series taken around Les Halles, in which Brassaï recorded women he called the “Venuses of the Crossroads,” or prostitutes standing at their posts. With an aura of mystery, Brassaï captured one of these ladies of the evening as she stood on the puddled street corner, smiling into the shadows.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/100079/untitled
Fra_66,Le Corbusier (Charles-Édouard Jeanneret),Ink on laid paper,Club de Centre Rural: Perspective Sketch,"Born Charles-Édouard Jeanneret, French architect Le Corbusier was one of the pillars of modern architecture. Concerned with the general principles of urban planning, his radical designs were intended to improve universal living conditions by addressing basic needs, attending to physical comfort, and promoting social discourse. Drafting was a vital, theoretical part of Le Corbusier’s process. To promote his ideas about modern building techniques and social reform, he published his drawings in books and in his journal, L’Esprit nouveau, disseminating his views to a wide audience. Le Corbusier was a crusader for new technologies and materials, such as reinforced concrete and pillar foundations. These resources liberated architectural design, allowing for the creation of vast, open floor plans with unobstructed window walls. Club de Centre Rural alludes to Le Corbusier’s rational yet humane vision of urban life. This perspective sketch, which displays Le Corbusier’s trademark economy of line, depicts a large, airy space in which clusters of people congregate. The building is constructed of plain walls and slender supporting pillars, divided and fronted by walls of pure glass.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/104043/club-de-centre-rural-perspective-sketch
Fra_67,Jacques-Émile Ruhlmann,"Oak, mahogany, amboyna, ebony, and ivory veneer",Corner Cabinet,"This sumptuously veneered corner cabinet is arguably a signature piece of the Art Deco era. The term Art Deco, used since the 1960s to refer to the high-style interiors of the years between the two world wars, is derived from the title of the 1925 Paris International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts (Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes). This cabinet’s triangular form, with its serpentine door, is supported on short, fluted legs that are shod with ivory on the two front feet and terminate at the knees with a scroll flourish. Jacques-Émile Ruhlmann employed ebony and ivory to depict the large urn from which an abundance of stylized flowers and leaves cascades, overflowing the limits of the container to form a black-and-white oval that contrasts with the warm tone of the amboyna wood.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/148412/corner-cabinet

Fra_90,Claude Monet,Oil on canvas,Cliff Walk at Pourville,"In February 1882, Claude Monet went to Normandy to paint, one of many such expeditions that he made in the 1880s. This was also a retreat from personal and professional pressures. His wife, Camille, had died three years earlier, and Monet had entered into a domestic arrangement with Alice Hoschedé (whom he would marry in 1892, after her husband’s death). France was in the midst of a lengthy economic recession that affected Monet’s sales. In addition, the artist was unenthusiastic about the upcoming seventh Impressionist exhibition—divisions within the group had become pronounced by this time—and he delegated the responsibility for his contribution to his dealer, Paul Durand-Ruel.Disappointed in the area around the harbor city of Dieppe, which he found too urban, Monet settled in Pourville and remained in this fishing village until mid-April. He became increasingly enamored of his surroundings, writing to Hoschedé and her children: “How beautiful the countryside is becoming, and what joy it would be for me to show you all its delightful nooks and crannies!” He was able to do so in June, when they joined him in Pourville.The two young women strolling in Cliff Walk at Pourville are probably Marthe and Blanche, the eldest Hoschedé daughters. In this work, Monet addressed the problem of inserting figures into a landscape without disrupting the unity of its painterly surface. He integrated these elements with one another through texture and color. The grass—composed of short, brisk, curved brushstrokes—appears to quiver in the breeze, and subtly modified versions of the same strokes and hues suggest the women’s wind-whipped dresses and shawls and the undulation of the sea. X-radiographs show that Monet reduced the rocky outcropping at the far right to balance the proportions of sea and sky.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/14620/cliff-walk-at-pourville

Fra_94,Claude Monet,Oil on canvas,Water Lily Pond,"In 1893, three years after buying property at Giverny, Claude Monet began transforming the marshy ground behind his home into a pond, on the narrow end of which he built a Japanese-style wood bridge. Adding both exotic and domestic plantings, including his famous water lilies, the artist created the garden that would be one of his principal subjects for the rest of his life. Water Lily Pond was among the 18 similar versions of the motif that he made in 1899–1900; their common theme was the mingling of the lilies with reflections of other vegetation on the pool’s surface.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/87088/water-lily-pond

Pools of water in interlocking, abstract zones of acidic color surround the feet of a bather, who is flanked by two prone figures—or perhaps the same person seen from two angles.Unlike his other Tahitian-inspired landscapes, this painting was produced in Paris shortly after Paul Gauguin’s first trip to the island.

Although he specialized in engraved portraits, he also made prints after other artists, such as this charming portrait of N. Poisson as Crispin, the unscrupulous comic valet of the Comedie-Francaise, based on the portrait by Theodorus Netscher (active in Paris in 1679-99), the eldest son of the famous portrait artist Caspar Netscher.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/143/crispin
Fra_102,Claude Monet,Oil on canvas,"Stacks of Wheat (End of Day, Autumn)","The monumental stacks that Claude Monet depicted in his series Stacks of Wheat rose fifteen to twenty feet and stood just outside the artist’s farmhouse at Giverny. Through 1890 and 1891, he worked on this series both in the field, painting simultaneously at several easels, and in the studio, refining pictorial harmonies. In May 1891, Monet hung fifteen of these canvases next to each other in one small room in the Galerie Durand-Ruel in Paris. An unprecedented critical and financial success, the exhibition marked a breakthrough in Monet’s career, as well as in the history of French art. In this view, and in nearly all of the autumn views in the series, the conical tops of the stacks break the horizon and push into the sky. But in most of the winter views, which constitute the core of the series, the stacks seem wrapped by bands of hill and field, as if bedded down for the season. For Monet, the stack was a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival. He followed this group with further series depicting poplars, the facade of Rouen Cathedral, and, later, his own garden at Giverny.

Fra_111,Claude Monet,Oil on canvas,Apples and Grapes,"Claude Monet probably painted this and other still lifes in 1879–80, knowing that they would be more readily marketable than his landscapes. In Apples and Grapes, however, he employed the complexity of color, light, and texture found in his most Impressionist landscapes. This is particularly evident in the extensive cloth surface—the play of light on the horizontal brushstrokes (indicating the folds in the tablecloth) recalls earlier canvases in which Monet used similar short horizontals of variegated colors to suggest water rippling in the sunlight.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16549/apples-and-grapes

Although at first glance its composition seems similar to the finished canvas, its 20 or more figures have little to do with the final version. The trio at right with an elderly seated figure, for example, was completely rethought in the completed work, where they are replaced by a man in a top hat and a woman walking a monkey on a leash. This ironic combination of grand solemnity and wry humor is totally absent from the sketch’s awkwardly positioned figures.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/61616/oil-sketch-for-a-sunday-on-la-grande-jatte-1884

Fra_115,Georges Seurat,Oil on panel,Final Study for “Bathers at Asnières”,"Georges Seurat made this painting as a preparatory work for his monumental Bathers at Asnières, now in the National Gallery, London. It shows men and boys on the bank of the Seine River in the working-class Parisian suburb of Asnières. The view presented here is just across the river from the leisure park Seurat immortalized in his best-known work, A Sunday on La Grande Jatte—1884. The frozen gestures and sedate poses of these bathers set a mood distinct from the sparkling scenes of Parisians enjoying restaurants and other riverbank activities favored by the Impressionists. Nevertheless, Seurat’s focus on a subject from modern life, his luminous palette, and his airy brushwork show how the young artist adapted characteristics of Impressionist painting for his own purposes.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/20199/final-study-for-bathers-at-asnieres
Fra_116,Édouard Manet,Oil on canvas,The Races at Longchamp,"With a characteristic focus on the pleasures of modern life, Édouard Manet depicted this scene of the racetrack in the Bois de Boulogne, on the western outskirts of Paris. The popularity of Longchamp, where races were run for the first time in 1857, signaled a general revival in French horse racing. This painting records the last moments of a race, as the horses rush past the finish line, indicated by the pole with a circular top. Unlike traditional sporting artists, who always showed races from the side, Manet dared to compose the scene so that the throng of horses and jockeys thunders straight toward the viewer.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/81533/the-races-at-longchamp

Although he did not consider these to be a series, like the 25 paintings of stacks of wheat that he began shortly after the harvest that same summer, the works certainly show his growing interest in developing several canvases at once. They also demonstrate a far more homogeneous touch than the freely brushed landscapes of his earlier career, with surfaces that have a tapestry-like materiality.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/4783/poppy-field-giverny

Cezanne rendered the unusual perspective—looking down onto the rooftops of Auvers and out to the distant countryside—using blocky, energetic patches of color and areas of ragged brushwork that seem unfinished, especially at the lower left and center. These choices, which were radical at the time, mark his attempt to communicate not merely the landscape’s appearance but also the feeling of seeing it and painting it.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/14556/auvers-panoramic-view

Fra_123,Balthus,Oil on board,Girl with Cat,"Balthus’s legendary secretiveness has inhibited critical commentary on his paintings. His son Stanislas appears at times to have been his spokesman, arguing that the girls in his father’s paintings are “emblematic archetypes… their very youth the symbol of an ageless body of glory, as adolescence (from the Latin adolescere: to grow toward) aptly symbolizes that heavenward state of growth which Plato refers to in the Timaeus” (Klossowski de Rola 1983, p. 10). He also suggested, a little more plausibly, that the paintings emphasize the act of seeing, though unfortunately he used this as an excuse to propose that an ideal state can be achieved from their contemplation “wherein the act of seeing, the seen and the seer become one” (Klossowki de Rola 1983, p. 8). All the evidence of these senses appealed to in such paintings— nostalgia, lubricity, frustration— work against such a reading.Most literature on this painting considers alternative identifications of the cat, with either Balthus’s model, Therese Blanchard, the daughter of a neighbor, or with the artist himself. The latter interpretation is supported by Balthus’s long-standing fascination with cats. In 1920, at the age of thirteen, he published a series of prints narrating the story of a cat called Mitsou; even more directly relevant to the artist’s personal identification with this animal is his 1935 self-portrait entitled H.M. the King of Cats (New York 1984, no. 9, ill.). In addition in the work of writers in Balthus’s circle, there is considerable support for the association of the cat with sexuality. Georges Bataille’s erotic novel Histoire de l’oeil (Paris, 1928), for instance, has a chapter entitled “L’Oeil de chat” (The Cat’s eye) in which a sixteen-year-old boy and girl engage in sexual play with a cat’s saucer of milk. However, an exclusive emphasis on these readings overstresses the biographical in Balthus’s work and overlooks the degree to which he refers to and plays upon traditions of representing sexuality in Western painting.The genre of salacious images of women with which Balthus’s Girl with Cat is aligned traditionally include a small animal: cat or lap dog. The most famous examples perhaps are Jean Antoine Watteau’s Lady at Her Toilette of 1716/17 (London, Wallace Collection) and Edouard Manet’s Olympia of 1865 (Paris, Musee d’ Orsay), but any number of thinly veiled Venuses or clothed beauties in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century painting carry, fondle, or are watched by a pet. Typical commentaries of the time would remark on how fortunate the pet was to enjoy such privileged proximity to the desired object. Unspoken, but often visually very obvious parallels were also made between the creature and the female body. Traditionally the animal thus has a double identity, related to both the artist/ voyeur and the female sex.The setting of Girl with Cat has many of the traditional trappings of the painter’s studio. Therese lies on a daybed that figures in several other paintings by Balthus; on the left, the back of an upholstered chair is barely recognizable because of the rococo swatch of blue fabric bunched around one of its arms (similar chairs appear in Balthus’s paintings The White Skirt of 1937 and Therese of 1938).— Entry, Dawn Ades, Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1997, p. 6-7.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/117241/girl-with-cat
Fra_124,Claude Monet,Oil on canvas,"Houses of Parliament, London","During his London campaigns, Claude Monet painted the Houses of Parliament in the late afternoon and at sunset from a terrace at Saint Thomas’s Hospital. This viewpoint was close to that of the English artist J. M. W. Turner in his visionary paintings of the fire that had destroyed much of the old Parliament complex in 1834. In his response to the poetry of dusk and mist, however, Monet was actually inspired by the work of a more recent painter of the Thames, the American James McNeill Whistler.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16584/houses-of-parliament-london

The couple feed each other grapes—a fruit associated with Bacchus, god of pleasure—suggesting that their encounter is not entirely chaste. François Boucher’s compositions on pastoral themes comprise his most influential contribution to 18th-century French art. These lush and playful fantasies of rustic life, designed primarily for the private enjoyment of wealthy financiers and aristocrats, had little to do with the social realities of rural labor during the period.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/44742/are-they-thinking-about-the-grape-pensent-ils-au-raisin

These works show only three different views—Charing Cross Bridge and Waterloo Bridge, both painted from the Savoy Hotel; and the Houses of Parliament, painted from Saint Thomas’s Hospital. In the smoggy, industrial city, Monet challenged himself to capture effects of light seen through a dense atmospheric screen.

Building a large studio and improving his garden, he began a group of monumental paintings of water lilies that he would later offer to the French state. Alongside this project, he painted a suite of 19 smaller canvases, including the present one. There is evidence—including a few photographs of the artist working in his garden—that Monet conceived these paintings outdoors and then reworked them in his studio.

Lacking a discernible horizon or clear sense of depth, the viewer is both on top of and submerged in this encrusted and disorienting surface, suggestive of water, on which various vegetal and floral forms float.Together with other related canvases, this work remained in the artist’s Giverny studio long after his death in 1926 and was only rediscovered in the 1950s, having suffered localized damage by shrapnel from shells during World War II. In 1956 the Art Institute’s pioneering curator of modern art, Katherine Kuh, bought this painting from Katia Granoff’s gallery in Paris. Kuh recognized a formal affinity between Monet’s late experimental painting and the public’s growing interest in large-scale, abstract works like those by Jackson Pollock, whose Greyed Rainbow entered the Art Institute’s collection in 1955.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/4887/irises

This picture, undertaken around 1860, speaks to his ambition to realize canvases featuring scenes from the Bible, as well as ancient and more recent history. Degas took his subject from the life of Lycurgus, a legendary ninth-century b.c. Spartan lawgiver. Lycurgus’s social reforms included an unusual method of physical training in which adolescent girls competed on an equal footing with boys, exercising nude in public. Degas would have worked up this monochromatic sketch with layers of color had he completed it, but he left it unfinished when he began a second version of the subject (National Gallery of Art, London).",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/13487/young-spartan-girls-challenging-boys

A wooden barrier bisects the composition, dividing the frenzied action of the dance floor in the background from the stillness of the women waiting in the foreground.

Although not intended as a criticism, others used the name to attack this new direction in avant-garde art. The Fauves were not a formally unified group, but their style was nevertheless distinct, characterized by their use of vibrant, unmixed paint and rough, spontaneous brushwork. The thick application, explosive color, and subject of Houses at Chatou—possibly one of the works included in the 1905 Salon—reveal the importance of the work of Vincent van Gogh to the Fauves.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/74699/houses-at-chatou

Fra_152,Henri Rousseau,Oil on canvas,The Waterfall,"Among the very last compositions Henri Rousseau painted, The Waterfall is typical of the large-scale jungle scenes for which he gained renown in the 20th century. A self-taught artist who worked by day as a customs agent until the age of 49, Rousseau never set foot outside of France. Instead, he learned about the flora and fauna of far-away places through visits to Paris botanical gardens and zoos as well as in popular books. As a result, his landscapes often reflect how Parisians at the time imagined France’s colonial empires in Africa and the Americas. Here, he created a secluded vignette of two dark-skinned figures and a pair of deer at a stream surrounded by dense foliage. As we look upon them, seemingly undetected or just noticed by the deer, we encounter a fictional scene that reflects 20th-century European ideas about escaping modernity and returning to more peaceful origins.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/28096/the-waterfall

On a Balcony, which was shown in the 1880 Impressionist exhibition, appears to depict a woman in a public setting. However, the blue rail of the balcony, visible near the top of the painting, defines the enclosed space of a private garden, and the woman’s morning dress further indicates the intimacy of her location. Cassatt signaled the modernity of her subject through the woman’s choice of reading material: she peruses a newspaper rather than a novel, demonstrating that even at home, Cassatt’s subjects are connected to the contemporary world.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/26650/on-a-balcony
Fra_169,Eugène Delacroix,Oil on canvas,Lion Hunt,"In 1832 Eugène Delacroix joined a diplomatic envoy to French-colonized Algeria. The sights and experiences from this six-month journey fueled the rest of his career, lending his canvases an illusion of accuracy that his less-traveled competitors lacked. The artist expressed in his journals from abroad his admiration for Arab culture, even characterizing it as superior to that of post-revolutionary France. Nevertheless, in paintings like this he catered to violent European fantasies about the Arab world. Having never witnessed a lion hunt, Delacroix skillfully synthesized studies of landscapes, Islamic costume, and zoo animals to bring this narrative to life with theatrical intensity.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/81505/lion-hunt

Fra_176,Hubert Robert,Oil on canvas,The Old Temple,"The four large canvases by Hubert Robert in the Art Institute’s collection were commissioned by wealthy ﬁnancier Jean-Joseph, Marquis de Laborde, to decorate a salon in his château at Méréville, France. Installed on all sides of the room, they would have suggested that the walls had dissolved, revealing fantasies of Classical architecture animated by scenes of everyday life. Robert was much sought after as a painter of architectural ruins, a genre that appealed to the late 18th-century taste for the antique.

Fra_177,Pierre Puvis de Chavannes,Oil on canvas,"The Sacred Grove, Beloved of the Arts and the Muses","The indeterminately mythological figures that populate this peaceful landscape are intended to evoke a poetic conception of the artistic past. The figures in the center personify the three plastic arts: architecture, painting, and sculpture. They are surrounded by the nine muses of Classical antiquity.The scene’s subdued, chalky colors and overall flatness recall Roman wall paintings. Indeed, Pierre Puvis de Chavannes was the leading muralist in France when he first displayed this painting at the 1884 Salon, a state-sponsored art exhibition; this canvas is itself a smaller version of a mural he made for the stairway of the Musée des Beaux-Arts in Lyon, France. That work was one of the inspirations for Georges Seurat’s mural-sized painting A Sunday on la Grande Jatte—1884.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/81566/the-sacred-grove-beloved-of-the-arts-and-the-muses

He also revisited an Impressionist subject that his colleagues had all but abandoned by the 1890s—the modern city. This bustling scene, alive with the noise and movement of traffic and pedestrians, was the view from his window at the Hôtel Garnier in Paris, where he stayed for a few weeks early in 1893. The building at the left edge of the canvas is the Gare Saint-Lazare.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/81551/the-place-du-havre-paris
Fra_179,Claude Monet,Oil on canvas,The Petite Creuse River,"Claude Monet began this canvas—one of three of the Petite Creuse—in April 1889 but only returned to it later that spring, by which time the landscape had changed considerably. The oak tree, for example, was sprouting leaves, obscuring the view he had already established. Rather than rework or restart the canvas to depict the current season, Monet hired workers to defoliate the tree so that he could re-create its earlier appearance.Monet spent three months in the remote Creuse valley in central France beginning in early March 1889 after visiting the region for a few days with art critic Gustave Geffroy in February. Despite bouts of poor health and bad weather, he returned to Giverny having painted 24 canvases. These constituted the artist’s first planned and rigorously defined series of paintings.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/81546/the-petite-creuse-river
Fra_180,Constantin Brancusi,Bronze,Sleeping Muse,"Brancusi sculpted his first “sleeping head” in 1907, and within three years had developed the tapered, egg-shaped form seen here, which he initially executed in marble. Placed on its side in an unconventional manner, yet in a way that feels natural to the subject of sleep, the sculpture imparts an essential poetry between the slumbering figure and the unencumbered way Brancusi chose to present its form. On one hand, the absence of a base suggests that the sculpture may have toppled over; on the other hand, it shows the muse in a posture of both physical and metaphorical rest, as if cheek to pillow.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/9024/sleeping-muse

The artist treated his domestic subject—a middle-class woman embroidering a textile—with vibrant color, light-filled atmosphere, and freely handled paint. Cobalt blue dominates the composition with striking contrasts of red and spare touches of yellow, relying on the optical effect produced by the close proximity of primary colors to enliven the composition and increase the sense of direct observation and spontaneity.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/14647/young-woman-sewing
Fra_184,Édouard Manet,Oil on canvas,Beggar with a Duffle Coat (Philosopher),"This painting and Beggar with Oysters were probably conceived as companion pieces. Édouard Manet exhibited them together in 1872, along with paintings of an absinthe drinker and a ragpicker, under the collective title Philosophers. The beggars of Paris, nonconformist types under threat from government schemes intended to drive them out of the city, held a particular fascination for Realist artists and writers. By setting his large-scale figures against empty, dark backgrounds, Manet added to their portraitlike, indeed heroic, presence. By a remarkable coincidence, at the turn of the 20th century, these two closely related works found their way by very different means to the Art Institute’s collection.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/95183/beggar-with-a-duffle-coat-philosopher

Fra_186,Claude Monet,Oil on canvas,Vétheuil,"In summer 1901 Claude Monet rented a modest house in Lavacourt, a small hamlet across the Seine from Vétheuil and not far from his property at Giverny, which he was in the process of expanding. He began 15 paintings of Vétheuil from the balcony of this rented home, all of which feature the same restricted view of the riverbank and town—punctuated by the church—and document the changes in light throughout the day. The Art Institute holds two paintings from the series, one from midday and another from sunset. Painted on nearly square canvases, Monet divided each composition in half, separating the town from its reflection. Rather than replicating the area’s topography or creating a convincing illusion of space, Monet emphasized the decorative over the descriptive qualities of this riverscape. His loose brushwork and subtle color transitions blur the distinctions between the scene’s various forms, dissolving the borders, for example, between the water and the land and the land and the sky. The shapes of the different buildings along the shoreline emerge through changes in the direction of brushstrokes and slight shifts in hue.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/14634/vetheuil
Fra_187,Claude Monet,Oil on canvas,Boats on the Beach at Étretat,"Forced indoors by inclement fall weather, Claude Monet painted Boats on the Beach at Étretat and The Departure of the Boats, Étretat while looking out the window of his room at the Hôtel Blanquet. The two form a pair that share a palette, subject, and vantage point. In one of his daily letters to his companion and future wife, Alice Hoschedé, dated November 24, 1885, Monet he described first Boats on the Beach and then Departure of the Boats: “In the afternoon, I worked in my room on my caloges [retired fishing boats covered with tarred planks and used for storage] in the rain, then I attempted to do, always through the window, a picture of the boats departing.”Monet centered each composition on the boats, combining pastel blues, pinks, purples, and greens to render wet surfaces. The brightly colored hulls of beached crafts lend relative scale to the structures in Boats on the Beach, and the groups of figures at the water’s edge, composed of quick, gestural strokes, register human activity in Departure of the Boats.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/59927/boats-on-the-beach-at-etretat
Fra_188,Paul Cezanne,Oil on canvas,The Bathers,"Paul Cezanne set this idyllic view of a group of bathers in a frame of foliage. He rendered the ground, water, trees, and sky with patches of hatching that seem to register the energy he felt when painting. His primary concern, however, seems to have been striking a balance between the vigor of the bodies and the restfulness of the setting through individual poses and figure groupings—some invented, some likely derived from his other works depicting this subject.Over the course of his career, Cezanne frequently revisited groups of bathers in nature. Through his multiple studies of the subject, he reconceived the classical motif of nudes outdoors in a modern style.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/45240/the-bathers
Fra_189,Man Ray (Emmanuel Radnitzky),"Pen and black ink, and graphite with smudging, with colored pencils and colored crayons on tan wove paper",Exquisite Corpse,"The so-called cadavre exquis or exquisite corpse, a Surrealist visual game, was created in winter 1925–26, when members of the group gathered in the evenings. If conversation lagged, they invented games to spark the unconscious. The exquisite corpse grew out of one such invention, which reimagined the children’s game of “head, body, legs,” in which each participant adds to a drawing without seeing the preceding contributions, which are hidden by folding the paper. The results are strange, sometimes violent, combinations of images. The Surrealists produced many such drawings (the Art Institute has several; for example, 2018.333, 2018.334, and 2018.335), and these collaborative experiments were profoundly influential. The Chicago-based Hairy Who artists also played the game in the late 1960s, but with more playful results (for example, 2018.684, 2018.685, 2018.686, 2018.687, 2018.688, and 2018.689).",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/119117/exquisite-corpse

They spent these years in Lower Norwood, outside London. In the neighboring town of Sydenham, Pissarro painted the glass-and-iron Crystal Palace, which was originally designed by Joseph Paxton in 1851 for London’s Hyde Park. Although it was immediately acclaimed for its modern architecture, only two years later the building was dismantled and reassembled in Sydenham. (It was destroyed by fire in 1936.) In this small oil painting, Pissarro relegated what was considered the world’s largest building to the left side of the canvas, as if to give equal space to the “modern-life” scene of families and carriages parading by Sydenham’s more recently constructed middle-class homes.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/110541/the-crystal-palace

Nonetheless, Nanteuil would engrave 12 portraits of the king, and draw him in person on more than one occasion. As his career progressed, Nanteuil’s prints grew more painterly in quality, with subtler chiaroscuro effects, evident here in the carefully hatched shadows behind Louis XIV.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/10876/louis-xiv

Broken and Restored Multiplication is filled with visual and verbal metaphors of disorder and breakage: at the center, a schematic Eiffel Tower is turned upside down; just below it, a modern cityscape is reflected in its mirror image. The phrases that run up and down along the surface of the picture further the idea of order upended: “The mirror would shatter, the scaffolding would totter, the balloons would fly away, the stars would dim, etc.” Such images and words seemed fitting for the artists who embraced Dada, a cultural movement that emerged in response to World War I.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/134050/broken-and-restored-multiplication

Here, Renoir portrayed Lucie, Berard’s youngest and one of the artist’s favorite models, as the picture of innocence at three years old. Her small hands, positioned rather formally at her sides, lack the accessories, like toys and books, found in some other of Renoir’s portraits of children; her white dress and subtle smile invoke a serene but fleeting moment of youth.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16600/lucie-berard-child-in-white

Here he looked to the 17th-century Baroque artist Diego Velázquez, whose two paintings of world-weary philosophers (Aesop and Menippus, both c. 1638) Manet had admired that year at the Museo del Prado in Madrid, Spain. Like Velázquez’s representation of the ancient stoics (whose poverty is associated with wisdom), Manet’s beggar-philosophers fit into the popular notion of the social outcast as a seer possessing rare insight.This painting and Beggar with a Duffle Coat were probably conceived as companion pieces.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/8969/beggar-with-oysters-philosopher
Fra_201,Claude Monet,Oil on canvas,"Stack of Wheat (Thaw, Sunset)","The monumental stacks that Claude Monet depicted in his series Stacks of Wheat rose fifteen to twenty feet and stood just outside the artist’s farmhouse at Giverny. Through 1890 and 1891, he worked on this series both in the field, painting simultaneously at several easels, and in the studio, refining pictorial harmonies. In May 1891, Monet hung fifteen of these canvases next to each other in one small room in the Galerie Durand-Ruel in Paris. An unprecedented critical and financial success, the exhibition marked a breakthrough in Monet’s career, as well as in the history of French art. In this view, and in nearly all of the autumn views in the series, the conical tops of the stacks break the horizon and push into the sky. But in most of the winter views, which constitute the core of the series, the stacks seem wrapped by bands of hill and field, as if bedded down for the season. For Monet, the stack was a resonant symbol of sustenance and survival.

The artist is known to have acquired corpses from his local morgue to study anatomy and the effects of decomposition. Surrounding himself with the stench of decay, he produced several paintings of decapitated heads and severed limbs. By depicting this graying and lifeless head upon on a blood-stained cloth laid over a wooden table, Géricault also referenced—perhaps ironically—the long history of still-life painting in Western art. The head probably belonged to a convicted criminal.

Within a year of purchasing the painting, Rosenberg, among other Jewish dealers, was targeted by the Nazis and was forced to flee France.

The artist’s genesis of this large canvas involved many preparatory studies, which fall primarily into two groups: small compositional sketches and color studies on wooden panels, and nuanced Conté crayon drawings that explore both the empty landscape and the shapes of specific figures or figural groups.

Optimistically embracing the clean aesthetic and dynamic potential of the machine, Duchamp-Villon reinterpreted the traditional subject of equestrian sculpture for the modern era. The artist completed only a small plaster of the final version of Horse; he died before he could realize his plans to enlarge and cast it in bronze.

In this early picture, Auguste Bernard drew upon history paintings by Peter Paul Rubens and Charles Le Brun, as well as Parisian traditions of genre painting and portraiture pioneered by Jean-Baptiste Greuze.

Their familial pose and other details, such as the woman’s gold ring and the red mark on the girl’s hand, invite speculation as to their relationship to each other and to the artist. Technical analysis has revealed that Paul Gauguin reworked the position of the woman’s hands to align diagonally with those of the young girl standing behind her. Together, they form an upward axis reinforced by the cat, also a later addition.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/34461/polynesian-woman-with-children
Fra_229,Constantin Brancusi,Marble,Leda,"Sculptor Constantin Brancusi believed the material with which he worked had its own life, a uniqueness and essence that he had to seek out in order to reveal the form contained within. In Leda, sculptural metamorphosis became the very subject of the work. According to classical mythology, the god Zeus changed into a swan in order to seduce the beautiful Leda. Brancusi explained to visitors to his studio that he chose to transform the transformation—changing Leda, rather than Zeus, into a swan. He explained, “I never could imagine a male being turned into a swan, impossible, but a woman, yes, quite easily.” Brancusi envisioned the form “ceaselessly creating a new life, a new rhythm,” which he enhanced by its circular concrete base, a type that he designed by 1916 and used in various sizes for many different sculptures.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/79382/leda

Fra_232,Eugène Louis Boudin,Oil on cradled panel,Approaching Storm,"This painting by Eugène Boudin, a Norman painter and Claude Monet’s teacher, exemplifies the artist’s signature style and subject matter in the 1860s. Monet would later follow Boudin’s practice of painting in the open air, the technique that gave this image of a beach for middle-class vacationers its vivid spontaneity and atmospheric light. This practice would be particularly important for Monet and his contemporaries, who came to be known as the Impressionists.Eugène-Louis Boudin painted many beach scenes at the fashionable tourist spots of Trouville and Deauville in Normandy. In them we see the life of the Paris boulevards translated to the seashore. Bathing attire being still relatively rare, people wore the same clothes at the beach as they did in the city and made the same round of promenades, visits, and dinners. The huts on wheels are portable changing machines that were pulled into the water so that bathers could change without fear of exposure.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/27764/approaching-storm

In a letter to his friend the poet Charles Baudelaire, he described a bullfight he attended in Madrid as “one of the finest, most curious and most terrifying sights to be seen.” He made quick sketches there that informed several later canvases, including this one.

The painting’s setting and title suggest that she is a courtesan in a harem. For 19th-century European artists, depicting the nude female form was a fundamental component of academic training and a benchmark of artistic excellence. The imagined harem setting—a space historically forbidden to men—provided narrative context for the nude and appealed to the sexual and colonialist fantasies of European audiences.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/100351/odalisque

Here, the artist disrupted expectations for painting at the time by tipping the tabletop and plate forward toward the viewer and constructing a table with edges that don’t quite align. These disorienting details are complemented by the heavy, almost sculptural forms he created by using a pointed tool—possibly the end of his brush handle—to incise contours into semi-dry paint around the plate and some of the apples.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/65811/the-plate-of-apples

Fra_240,Jean (Hans) Arp,White marble,Growth,"Jean Arp was a leader in the development of the organic, curving language of biomorphism, which infused Surrealism with forms alluding to growth, fecundity, and the natural world. In the early 1930s, Arp began to translate his abstract style into three-dimensional sculptures, emphasizing the natural processes of metamorphosis in art. The artist often realized his sculptures first in plaster, a medium that responded easily to touch and allowed for the element of chance in the creative process, and later in an edition in different media (often bronze). This sculpture is a unique marble enlargement of Arp’s original plaster. The medium—with its hard, bonelike appearance—emphasizes the human, torsolike forms of Growth.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/23365/growth

Fra_242,Camille Pissarro,Oil on canvas,Woman and Child at the Well,"By the 1880s, Camille Pissarro, like most of his Impressionist colleagues, sought an alternative to the style he had employed over the previous decade, deciding to focus on figures rather than landscapes. Of the 36 paintings he showed at the seventh Impressionist exhibition, in the spring of 1882, 27 were figural. Woman and Child at the Well is one of a series of works depicting peasant girls taking a break from their chores, their poses and gestures suggesting narratives that remain ambiguous. As the model for the boy in this composition, Pissarro used his fourth son, Ludovic-Rodolphe, who was four years old at the time.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/81552/woman-and-child-at-the-well
Fra_243,Jean Baptiste Joseph Wicar,Oil on canvas,"Virgil Reading the “Aeneid” to Augustus, Octavia, and Livia","In the late 18th century, the French Academy promoted a severely Classical approach to history painting as a means to regenerate art—and in contrast to the perceived decadence of the Rococo style. Jacques-Louis David and his students were leading exponents of this Neoclassical approach, treating antique subjects as moral exemplars for contemporary audiences. Here, David’s student Jean-Baptiste Wicar depicted the response of the Roman emperor Augustus and his family to Virgil’s reading of his epic poem the Aeneid, which tells the story of Aeneas, the Trojan prince who settled in Latium after many adventures and was viewed as an ancestor of Augustus. The emotionally charged gestures of Augustus and his sister Octavia suggest that they identify their own family drama with the heroic events recounted by Virgil.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/17161/virgil-reading-the-aeneid-to-augustus-octavia-and-livia
Fra_244,Édouard Manet,Oil on canvas,"Sea View, Calm Weather (Vue de mer, temps calme)","This is one of Édouard Manet’s earliest paintings of the sea, a subject to which he returned repeatedly. It is one of three or four works that he painted in Paris from sketches made on a vacation with his family in the northern port of Boulogne-sur-Mer. Though boldly brushed and almost calligraphic in form, the vessels remain identifiable as specific types.

Fra_246,Camille Pissarro,Oil on canvas,Young Peasant Having Her Coffee,"In the 1880s, at a time when many of the original Impressionist painters had begun to pursue independent styles, Camille Pissarro actively worked to keep the group together. He persuaded Gustave Caillebotte and Claude Monet to take part in the seventh Impressionist exhibition, in 1882, and also displayed a number of his own paintings of peasant girls. Here the small brushstrokes, applied one next to the other and sometimes overlaid with dabs of thicker paint, result in an irregularly built-up surface, serving to integrate figure and setting and evoke the textures of the young woman’s wool clothing.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/81548/young-peasant-having-her-coffee
Fra_247,Claude Monet,Oil on canvas,Vétheuil,"In summer 1901 Claude Monet rented a modest house in Lavacourt, a small hamlet across the Seine from Vétheuil and not far from his property at Giverny, which he was in the process of expanding. He began 15 paintings of Vétheuil from the balcony of this rented home, all of which feature the same restricted view of the riverbank and town—punctuated by the church—and document the changes in light throughout the day. The Art Institute holds two paintings from the series, one from midday and another from sunset. Painted on nearly square canvases, Monet divided each composition in half, separating the town from its reflection. Rather than replicating the area’s topography or creating a convincing illusion of space, Monet emphasized the decorative over the descriptive qualities of this riverscape. His loose brushwork and subtle color transitions blur the distinctions between the scene’s various forms, dissolving the borders, for example, between the water and the land and the land and the sky. The shapes of the different buildings along the shoreline emerge through changes in the direction of brushstrokes and slight shifts in hue.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16579/vetheuil
Fra_248,Alfred Sisley,Oil on canvas,"The Seine at Port-Marly, Piles of Sand","Of all the landscapes Alfred Sisley painted in and around Marly-le-Roi, where he lived from 1875 to 1878, this scene of workers dredging sand to facilitate barge traffic is perhaps the most original. Generally, the Impressionists showed the Seine River as a place of weekend leisure for Parisians, painting activities such as boating, yachting, promenading, and dining. Sisley depicted the river during the workweek, along with some of the men who depended on it for their livelihood.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16633/the-seine-at-port-marly-piles-of-sand

The conflict included a massacre in the Al-Azhar Mosque of Mamelukes, a military class of enslaved men who occupied much of the Middle East at that time. As there were no surviving eyewitness reports, Girodet was free to interpret the event as he wished, and, as a commission from Napoleon, the painting celebrates the French point of view. Throughout the work, Girodet perpetuates European fantasies of the Middle East as simultaneously opulent and brutal, lavishing attention on Arab and Ottoman turbans, luxurious fabrics, bare flesh, and gore.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/152851/sketch-for-the-revolt-of-cairo
Fra_251,Claude Monet,Oil on canvas,"The Departure of the Boats, Étretat","Forced indoors by inclement fall weather, Claude Monet painted Boats on the Beach at Étretat and The Departure of the Boats, Étretat while looking out the window of his room at the Hôtel Blanquet. The two form a pair that share a palette, subject, and vantage point. In one of his daily letters to his companion and future wife, Alice Hoschedé, dated November 24, 1885, Monet described first Boats on the Beach and then Departure of the Boats: “In the afternoon, I worked in my room on my caloges [retired fishing boats covered with tarred planks and used for storage] in the rain, then I attempted to do, always through the window, a picture of the boats departing.”Monet centered each composition on the boats, combining pastel blues, pinks, purples, and greens to render wet surfaces. The brightly colored hulls of beached crafts lend relative scale to the structures in Boats on the Beach, and the groups of figures at the water’s edge, composed of quick, gestural strokes, register human activity in Departure of the Boats. Monet purposefully arrived well after tourist season, so it is unclear whether he observed the fashionably dressed women at left or rather inserted them as a foil to the local fishermen at right.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/81540/the-departure-of-the-boats-etretat
Fra_252,Hilaire Germain Edgar Degas,Etching in black on ivory laid paper,Self-Portrait,"A work of surprising sophistication for a relatively young practitioner of the art, this etching was clearly inspired by the early graphic self-portraits of Rembrandt. Degas gleaned from the Baroque master his capacity to create an atmosphere from which a convincing presence emerges.This probing self-appraisal was made when the artist was only twenty-three years old. The maturity of Degas’s gaze is matched by the sophistication of his technique. He has printed this etching with a personalized, rich wiping of the plate that anticipates his later work in monotypes.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/13551/self-portrait
Fra_253,Auguste Rodin,Marble,Eve after the Fall,"Auguste Rodin’s sculpture Eve owes its genesis to The Gates of Hell, the artist’s major commission from the French government in 1880. The associations posed by the sculptural portals of that project led Rodin back to the art of Lorenzo Ghiberti and Michelangelo, particularly their depiction of biblical stories from the book of Genesis. A number of elements from the Gates—such as The Thinker, Adam, and Eve—gradually evolved into independent works. In particular, Eve recalls the most sculptural of Renaissance paintings: Michelangelo’s panels from the Sistine Chapel Ceiling and Masaccio’s Expulsion from the Garden of Eden. Its naturalism shocked critics when it was first exhibited, since Eve seemed to them more like a flesh-and-blood woman than an idealized creation.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16963/eve-after-the-fall

Madame Buron was particularly supportive of David’s desire to become a painter, in opposition to her husband’s wish that he study architecture. In this intimate early portrait, David presented his aunt looking up momentarily from her reading to acknowledge the viewer with a warm reserve. Her glance suggests an affectionate bond between the painter and sitter and displays the ambitious young artist’s awareness of contemporary conventions for depicting middle-class women of sensibility.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/88632/madame-francois-buron
Fra_256,Hubert Robert,Oil on canvas,The Landing Place,"The Landing Place is one of four works commissioned to decorate a salon in the château of Jean-Joseph, Marquis de Laborde, a successful ﬁnancier. This view is dominated by an immense colonnade, in front of which several people are shown departing in a pleasure boat while others linger at the water’s edge. As he constructed this fantasy, Hubert Robert included direct references to renowned antique monuments, combining them with elements of his own invention. The perspective and scale of Robert’s four painted architectural fantasies were coordinated with the proportions of the room to give the illusion of a vast, open space.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/57050/the-landing-place

Depicted against a dark background with only his palette and brushes to indicate his profession, he looks at the viewer as if caught unawares. The unseen easel and canvas must be located immediately in front of the artist and to our left.During his brief career, which ended when he was killed in the line of duty during the Franco-Prussian War, Frédéric Bazille produced about 70 paintings, 4 of them self-portraits. He created this work while sharing an apartment-studio with Claude Monet and experimenting with new painting techniques that would be central to the Impressionist movement. It was both a practice piece (in which Bazille observed and painted his reversed image as seen in a mirror) and, given his recent decision to abandon a medical career in favor of art, a professional manifesto.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/110661/self-portrait
Fra_261,Claude Monet,Oil on canvas,The Customs House at Varengeville,"Claude Monet painted the customs house at Varengeville, on the Normandy coast of France, four times in 1882 and four more times in 1897. On each occasion he chose a similar vantage looking down on the small structure, which appears to grow out of the cliffside. The dimensions of this version are nearly identical to those of the other three canvases from the second visit. Here, Monet increased the amount of white in his paints to capture more nuanced atmospheric effects. He also experimented with techniques to animate the surface, at times scraping down or wiping away the still-soft paint to expose underlying colors. In the water, for example, breaks in the pale-gray paint reveal a bright green beneath, which the artist accentuated with additional touches of a similar green on top.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16542/the-customs-house-at-varengeville

In 1879 France experienced an extraordinarily severe winter, which Pissarro explored in this and other works painted at his home in Pontoise, 30 miles west of Paris, along the Seine River. In Rabbit Warren, snow covers the ground, houses, and vegetation in a frothy coat that resulted from the artist’s vigorous brushwork. Throughout, small spots of color in the chimneys, greenish shrubs, and clothing of the man at right punctuate what is otherwise a predominately yellowish white and uninhabited fragment of nature.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/20530/rabbit-warren-at-pontoise-snow

The table around which they are posed displays many of the still-life elements that are arranged in a natural, random fashion in this work.

Instead of using various brushes to create a beautifully crafted and refined surface, Pissarro loaded his paint on heavily, often with a palette knife, in emulation of Gustave Courbet.

In the foreground, a man uses a stick to crack a coconut and a family rests in the grass with a sleeping dog beside them. The painting’s coarsely woven canvas, made of a fibrous plant matter (jute), is visible through the paint layer.

It features a grandiose vaulted space that frames an obelisk, with a peristyle, or colonnade, closing off the distance.

The technique, called pointillism, was originated by Signac’s friend Georges Seurat.

Here Alexander, who overthrew the Persian Empire, arrives at the tomb of its founder, Cyrus the Great (590/580–c. 529 B.C.), only to find that it has been desecrated. In choosing the subjects of this pair of moralizing landscapes, Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes was doubtless suggesting the transitory nature of empire and of life itself.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/100060/alexander-at-the-tomb-of-cyrus-the-great
Fra_279,Jean-Baptiste Oudry,Oil on canvas,"Still Life with Monkey, Fruits, and Flowers","Jean-Baptiste Oudry received numerous commissions from Louis XV of France, who admired his skill as a painter of animals and still lifes. The artist frequently combined his two specialties, as in this work, in which a monkey, an animal celebrated in this period for its mischievous and lustful character, snatches a few grapes. The French Rococo taste for the sensual is manifest in the lush, overripe quality of the fruits and flowers, reminiscent of 17th-century Flemish works that Oudry is known to have studied.

Fra_280,Jean Baptiste Siméon Chardin,Oil on canvas,The White Tablecloth,"Jean-Siméon Chardin won acclaim for the still lifes and quiet scenes of middle-class domestic life that he exhibited at salons sponsored by the Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture. In his early still lifes, such as this one, he incorporated motifs common to 17th-century Dutch and Flemish works: the foreshortened knife, the handle of which protrudes over the table’s edge; the overturned glass; and the remains of a meal. The work’s unusual shape reveals its original function as a screen for the opening of a fireplace.

The warm light there transformed the artist’s work profoundly, leading him to comment: “If I had painted in the north … my painting would have been different. There would have been browns, grays, shadings of color through perspective.” Painted during one of his sojourns to Nice, this picture’s challenging spatial construction, palpable paint texture, and patterned background recall the still lifes of Paul Cezanne.

Fra_288,François Boucher,Pastel on buff laid paper,Boy with a Carrot,"François Boucher, whose art epitomized the light-hearted sensuality of the Rococo style, was the most famous painter and decorator during the reign of Louis XV (r. 1715–74), and was championed by Madame de Pompadour, the king’s powerful mistress. Boucher seldom ventured from major paintings and decorative ensembles to do finished, independent works on paper. Nor did he pursue portraiture, apart from his depictions of royal patrons and members of his family. This engaging and fresh portrait of a boy, perhaps a studio apprentice, may well be one of Boucher’s first, and finest, forays into pastel drawing. With this adaptable and newly fashioned medium, Rococo artists were able to imbue their images with a spirited directness and sense of life. Here Boucher captured the dimple-cheeked lad just as he seems to turn, lips parted as if to speak. The youth’s attentive gaze, tousled hair, and delicately elegant city clothes herald the artist’s suave later manner as court painter. The same young model, again holding a carrot, appears in at least two paintings of pastoral subjects by Boucher.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/35692/boy-with-a-carrot
Fra_289,Auguste Rodin,Bronze,Portrait of Balzac,"In 1891 Auguste Rodin was commissioned by a literary society to produce a posthumous monument to the French writer Honoré de Balzac. Over the course of seven years, the sculptor created numerous studies for the composition, including this deliberately ungainly nude portrait. A departure from the idealized classical bodies typical of public statuary, this study stresses Balzac’s vitality and candor through its bold modeling, imposing torso, and confident stance. For the finished statue, in which the writer appears enveloped in a robe, Rodin continued to test the boundaries of sculpture, presenting his subject as an almost abstract, monolithic form. That version provoked harsh criticism from the public and was rejected by the literary society when first exhibited in 1898.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/6727/portrait-of-balzac

The painting was part of Paul Gauguin’s own collection, and here he proprietarily signed his name over its white frame. Of the five or six Cézannes that he acquired while still a banker, this was the one he claimed he would never part with, “except in a case of direst necessity.” (He would eventually sell it to pay for medical treatment in Tahiti.)

Although trained in the rigorous French academic traditions, he often emulated the broader style of Titian, Paolo Veronese, and other Venetian Renaissance masters. For his depiction of Christ washing Saint Peter’s feet just after the Last Supper (John 13:4-5), Bertin created a majestic, theatrical backdrop reminiscent of those in Veronese’s pictures.

According to the artist, the impetus for these works was a visit to the 1922 Colonial Exposition—an expansive exhibition demonstrating France’s dominance as a colonial power held in Marseille—where he observed a woman he understood to be of African descent. The anonymous subject, rendered as an elongated volume with just two features, lips and hair, reflected European stereotypes about African physiognomy, and presented the paradox of seeing a black body represented in light-colored materials. White in the title refers to the color of the marble, which at once relates to the tradition of marble statuary but also to an ongoing 20th-century fetishism of black bodies. In the blond versions, this same form appears in highly polished, mirror-like bronze.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/24845/white-negress-ii

Fra_305,Pierre-Auguste Renoir,Oil on canvas,The Laundress,"This canvas is Pierre-Auguste Renoir’s earliest painting of a laundress, a prevalent figure in the visual and literary culture of middle-class France in the 19th century. The model for the figure was Nini Lopez, a resident of Montmartre, the Parisian quarter to which Renoir moved in the summer of 1876. Lopez was characterized by writer and art critic Georges Rivière as the ideal model, for she was “punctual, serious, [and] discreet.” But while Lopez can be identified in The Laundress, this is not a portrait; her features are generalized and dissolve into a frenzy of brushstrokes. Instead, Renoir depicted a Parisian type—in this case, a young, working-class girl. When he painted this canvas, Renoir had recently finished four illustrations for Émile Zola’s L’Assommoir (The Drunkard), a gritty novel about the downfall of a laundress in the brutal and degrading world of working-class Paris. Renoir’s vibrant portrayal of the laundress in this canvas is markedly different from the laundress’s illustrated appearance, for which the Art Institute has a preparatory drawing.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/59944/the-laundress

Apparently dissatisfied with his complex imitation of Spanish Baroque art, he cut the original painting into three sections and reconceived this portion as an individual work of art. The artist painted out part of the head of a female gypsy, replaced blue sky with a dark brown ground, and extensively reworked the figure of the boy.

Fra_312,Jean Dubuffet,Oil on canvas,"Supervielle, Large Banner Portrait","Jean Dubuffet had a vast knowledge of classical art and culture, but he sought a new path for his art based outside Western artistic conventions. He became a proponent of art brut (raw art), an anti-aesthetic inspired by the art of children, the mentally ill, prisoners, and those “unscathed by artistic culture, where mimicry plays little or no part.” In his quest for a dynamic, expressive, and authentic style, Dubuffet developed a technique of scratching into thickly impastoed paint surfaces, often mixed with materials from the earth, to produce raw, graffiti-like images. This painting of the poet Jules Supervielle comes from a series of crude portraits of Parisian writers and intellectuals that the artist made from his imagination, depersonalizing and transforming his subjects into caricatures of human types.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/96625/supervielle-large-banner-portrait
Fra_313,Hilaire Germain Edgar Degas,"Pastel, over monotype, on textured cream wove paper, edge-mounted on board",Landscape with Smokestacks,"Degas is best known for his images of the ballet and other scenes from modern urban life. However, periodically he explored the landscape genre, with a trip in 1869 to the Normandy Coast, for example, that resulted in a number of pastel landscapes. During the peak years of Impressionism-the 1870s and 1880s, when landscape reigned supreme among France’s avant-garde-Degas was notoriously averse to the practice of open-air landscape painting. Yet in the 1890s, he produced several groups of landscapes, combining observation and invention in various ways. The artist’s renewed interest was prompted by a trip he took he took through Burgundy in 1890 that inspired him to treat its landscape using the technique of monotype. A monotype is made by painting or drawing an image in greasy printer ‘s ink on a metal plate and then printing the plate onto a sheet of paper. Only one strong impression can usually be pulled from the plate; on occasion, a second, paler impression known as a monotype cognate can be pulled as well. Degas sometimes completed pastels over monotypes or monotype, cognates, as in Landscape with Smokestacks. He pioneered this technique in the 1870s. He began some of his monotypes on the spot, while others-possibly Landscape with Smokestacks-were recollections. Certainly, Degas’s aim in such compositions was quite different from his colleague Claude Monet’s preoccupation with changing atmospheric effects. While rooted in experience, Degas’s landscapes of memory are brooding and mysterious.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/151507/landscape-with-smokestacks

Commissioned in 1780, one year after her first marriage, this bust of Louise de Domangeville presents the sitter as somewhat older than her 18 years. Houdon’s handling of the sculpture strikes a balance between the conversational intimacy of Rococo portraiture and the simplified dignity of Neoclassicism.

The soft and crumbly consistency of this medium allowed him to both blend colors and apply more assertive marks that remain distinct.

Fra_358,Henri Matisse,Bronze,The Serf,"Henri Matisse often turned to sculpture early in his career in an attempt “to put order into my feelings and find a style to suit me.” More than half of his total output of sculpture dates to between 1900 and 1909, and these works reveal a deep interest in the human figure, as well as ancient and early modern works of art. The Serf, one of Matisse’s earliest sculptures, consumed him: he was reported to have spent up to 500 sessions with his model, Bevilaqua, who also posed for Auguste Rodin. The Art Institute’s work is an early cast (1908) of a total edition of 10 and was once owned by Matisse’s most enthusiastic early supporters, Michael and Sarah Stein.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/64916/the-serf

At center, a carriage loaded with furniture transports a young woman with her baby while, to their right, a black hearse moves towards the ethereal Roman church in the distance.

Fra_368,Francis Picabia,Oil on canvas,Têtes-paysage,"Têtes-paysage (Heads-landscape) belongs to Picabia’s “Transparency” series, a group of works so named for the artist’s use of multilayered, transparent images. In the dreamlike tableaux of the transparencies, Picabia referenced visual sources ranging from ancient Rome to the Renaissance, often juxtaposing the sacred with the profane. These works draw on mythology, religion, and conventions of beauty and, in their blending of the unexpected, project a distinctly Surrealist sensibility. As much as they reflect the traditional world, however, they also mirror modern times: indeed, Picabia derived his simultaneous, nonhierarchical use of images from his experiments in film, especially his 1924 masterpiece with René Clair, Entr’acte.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/26082/tetes-paysage

For this unusual work, Carriès drew inspiration from two disparate sources: The merging of human and animal features nods to Darwin’s theory of evolution, first published in the mid-1800s.

In this watercolor Manet used a limited palette and a combination of techniques to depict Morisot against a blue-green background. He worked wet-into-wet for her dress, applying wet pigment onto an already wet surface before it had time to dry, which allowed the marks to bleed and blend into one another. Then Manet used a dry-brush technique to emphasize the texture of the fabric of her dress and the ribbon in her hair.

Fra_394,Francis Picabia,"Oil on canvas with wooden matchsticks, hairpins, coins, leather hair rollers, and string",Untitled (Match-Woman I),"Picabia was at the center of Dada’s more celebrated activities between 1917, the year he brought out the first issue of his irreverent journal 391, and October 1924, when he published the final issue of 391 (no. 19) attacking the new movement of Surrealism. Although he frequently collaborated with the Dadaists, he also occasionally denounced them from the platform of 391, of which he carefully retained control. Le Pilhaou-thibaou, the name given to issue number fifteen of 391 (July 10, 1921), inveighed against Paris Dada, but by the following year, the wounds were healed and Picabia happily collaborated with André Breton and his group on a new series of the journal Littérature, designing many of its most provocative covers (see London, Hayward Gallery, Dada and Surrealism Reviewed, 1978, exh. cat. by Dawn Ades, pp. 161-75). While Marcel Duchamp, beginning in 1912, was the first to explore the symbolicand anti-aesthetic possibilities of the machine and mechanical imagery, it was Picabia who, perhaps more than any other artist, later pursued the theme with magnificent inventiveness. In many ways Picabia represented the public face of Dada, regularly exhibiting at the official salons in Paris, which he taunted through his use of highly unconventional materials, a characteristic exemplified by the Bergman work.While acknowledging this picture’s indisputable originality, scholars have raised some questions about the accuracy of the date 1920 inscribed at lower right. If correct, this date would place the work several years before any other work of its kind. William Camfield and Charles Stuckey have suggested that Picabia may have mistakeningly added this date well after the painting was completed. It is difficult to date Picabia’s work from the Dada years because he often experimented with radically different styles. This work seems to relate most closely to a group of collages which are dated roughly between 1923 and 1926, and which are composed of such diverse mateials as matches, toothpicks, drinking straws, coins, curlers, combs, hairpins, feathers, curtain rings, noodles, a tape measure, and even shoe soles. As in the Bergman picture, in these works Picabia arranged the collage elements on a simple, flat, painted background, and diverted the objects from their original, utilitarian function to make a coherent, clearly recognizable image.Several factors, nevertheless, seem to support a date of 1920 for this work. The March 1920 issue of 391 (no. 12) relfects Picabia’s increasing opposition to accepted art forms, an attitude that may well have prompted him to experiment with readymade materials. On thecover of this issue, he reproduced his own version of Duchamp’s Tableau Dada: LHOOQ—an image of Leonardo da Vinici’s Mona Lisa penciled over with a mustache (Picabia forgot the beard; Camfield 1979, pl. 19, between pp. 70 and 71, p. 141 n. 240. In addition, Picabia’s “Manifeste Dada” published in the same issue beneath the reproduction of Duchamp’s work, is one of his more aggresive attacks on modern art and its values— above all on Cubism. The following year he would utilize collage materials with a vengeance, culminating in his raucous submissions to the Salon des Indépendents of 1922. These consisted of The Merry Widow, Straw Hat?, and Saint Guy’s Dance, all of 1921. The last two include string, which is also a component of the Bergman collage. Finally, the rough capital letters of the signature and numerals of the date on the Berman work are consistent with those on a group of 1920 portraits of his Dada colleagues and on a self-portrait.The other version of this work, Match-Woman II, formerly in Breton’s collection and dated 1924/25 can easily be distinguished from the Bergman version by the pendant on the woman’s necklace, signaled by a larger coin. In this second version, the arrangement of matches and white highlights gives the impression of lonfer, more disorderly hair; the figure’s head is also shorter and slightly wider. Most significantly, the face and neck are outlined with thick lines of light blue paint, rather than the string used in the Bergman collage and in workds of the early 1920s, such as the 1921 collage Straw Hat?.The tipped matchsticks, of which there are three different styles in the Bergman collage, convey with precision the prinked and permed appearance of a fashionable woman of the time. Dada’s relationship with fashion is intriguing and unexpectantly multifaceted. Breton was strongly influenced by Jacques Vaché, a dandy in the purest sese, while Picabia himself moved simultaneously in the worlds of the fashionable le tout Paris (Parisian high society, which included famous figures from the literacy and artistic worlds) and Dada. Fashion was a major theme of the 1921 “Salon Dada” exhibition at the Galerie Montaigne in Paris: an elegant male mannequin, for example, was poised high up on the wall above the installation, with a long row of knotted ties hanging from a balcony below his feet (Washington, D.C., National Museum of American Art, Perpetual Motif: The Art of Man Ray, 1988-90, exh. cat., p. 92, ill.) In 1921 Picabia described the Dadaists, with whom he was then at war, as ripe for Paul Poiret, a fashionable French couturier (Le Pilhaou-thibaou [July 10, 1921], p. 6). The back page of the July 1924 issue of 391 (no. 18, p. 126) featured an enigmatic photograph of a pearl necklace of French coins in the Bergman collage. That particular issue of 391 in fact focused on modern art and fashion: “Picasso,” Picabia wrote in one of his typical aphorisms, “creates modern anxiety in the manner of Paul Poiret” (p. 125).— Entry, Dawn Ades, Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1997, p. 216-218.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/118733/untitled-match-woman-i

The artist wrote of Detective:I cut the images from a specialized review of crime stories. The photographs—which are similar to those in our own photo albums—are as if from a play, and the people we see in them are the actors, assassins or victims. But it is impossible to differentiate among them, now that the images have been isolated from their context.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/47129/detective

A letter lies at the sitter’s feet alongside the glove she would have removed to open it. Her stoic expression suggests that its contents delivered grave, even ominous news. Rather than capturing a real moment in time, however, this painting plays with theatrical props, costume, and background scenery to transform its sitter into a character—the elegant and mysterious traveler. Over the course of his career, Blanche captured Manfred in various guises, both female and male. Such genre portraits were popularized by earlier painters, including one of Blanche’s greatest influences, Édouard Manet.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/69287/the-traveler

In Dalou’s plaster she is tenderly awakened by the deity while a mischievous faun (a half-human, half-goat creature) attempts to distract the couple with an offering of grapes.Aimé-Jules Dalou was a protégé of the sculptor Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux and spent his early years studying the art of the 18th century. His first success came with images of modern life, such as nursing mothers and infants, but he later undertook allegorical subjects and historical statues for public commissions in France’s Third Republic. This plaster was exhibited at the annual Paris Salon in 1892 and later used as the model for a marble version, now at the Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Massachusetts.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/100050/bacchus-consoling-ariadne

His celebrated images of the city after dark, published in 1932 as Paris de nuit (Paris by Night), changed both the way people saw Paris and the way other photographers took pictures. Inspired by his late-night wanderings, the book shows gardens and bridges, lovers and prostitutes, the lights of bars and the backstage areas of dance halls. Although this image of two thugs from Big Albert’s gang was not included in the book, it is typical of that work, with strong contrasts of dark and light and a voyeuristic aura of menace. The black area, which reads as a wall, is actually the edge of the photograph’s frame; Brassai printed half of the image, leaving a panel of black, as if in anticipation of its dramatic impact on the page.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/82580/two-apaches-in-paris

In 19th-century Paris, male abonnés (season ticket holders) had special access to a back room where they could socialize while watching the ballerinas warm up.

Like many of the artists in his circle, Toulouse-Lautrec experimented with styles and materials beyond easel painting. His decision to paint on a tambourine with little castanets (called a tambour de basque) was perhaps inspired by the instrument’s association with bohemian life and creative freedom.

Fra_531,Constantin Brancusi,Limestone,Wisdom,"Constantin Brancusi carved Wisdom from a block of limestone, highlighting its natural properties, especially its coarse texture. The artist’s interest in the stone’s materiality intersected with his desire to explore the essence of his subject in the most economical terms, evident in the form’s shallow, incised nose and tightly folded limbs. Brancusi further distilled his subject to its core by creating a figure that stands freely, without a base.In contrast to sculptors who modeled their work from materials such as clay or plaster and cast them in multiples, Brancusi directly carved his sculptures. He called this technique “the true road to sculpture” and drew inspiration from archaic, self-taught, and non-Western art.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/83907/wisdom

A famous literary hoax, the poems took Europe by storm. Here, Ossian’s father Fingal stands before the body of the dead Malvina, while her spirit ascends from the moonlit water behind him.

Fra_533,Pierre Henri de Valenciennes,Oil on canvas,Mount Athos Carved as a Monument to Alexander the Great,"Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes, a leading landscape artist in late-18th-century France, sought to elevate the art of landscape to the level of history painting. In the hierarchy of subjects set by the French artistic establishment, the painting of inspiring religious and historical narratives was placed higher than the imitation of nature. Valenciennes followed the 17th-century precedent of Nicolas Poussin by imbuing his landscapes with moral content. This work and its companion, Alexander at the Tomb of Cyrus the Great, address questions of fame and mortality through episodes from the life of Alexander the Great (356–323 B.C.). Here Valenciennes depicted an unrealized project to perpetuate Alexander’s glory—a monumental image of the ruler carved into Mount Athos.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/100061/mount-athos-carved-as-a-monument-to-alexander-the-great
Fra_534,Fernand Léger,Oil on canvas,Divers on a Yellow Background,"Long committed to ideals of social equality, Fernand Léger sought, especially during the latter part of his career, to reconcile modern art with the demands of a mass audience. Beginning in the mid-1930s, the artist executed many monumental works and turned with increasing frequency to the motif of the human figure, using organic forms inspired by the natural world rather than the geometric shapes of the man-made, machine-oriented one. Inspired by his memory of swimmers diving off the docks in Marseilles, Divers on a Yellow Background is one of numerous drawings and paintings on this theme that the artist realized while residing in the United States during World War II.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/111082/divers-on-a-yellow-background

Fra_537,Jacques Lipchitz,Limestone,Seated Figure,"Beginning in 1900, young painters and sculptors of all nationalities migrated to the Paris neighborhood of Montparnasse, the city’s hub of avant-garde activity. Despite their different approaches and interests, the artists of the so-called School of Paris fostered an inspiring climate of imaginative cross-fertilization that helped to sustain the idea of Paris as the center of artistic activity until the beginning of World War II. Jacques Lipchitz moved to Paris in 1909, and through his friendships with Diego Rivera, Pablo Picasso, and others, he participated in the Cubist movement. His bas-reliefs and sculptures in the round communicate the geometric and fractured forms and the favored subject matter (musicians and seated bathers, for example) of contemporary Cubist paintings.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/12101/seated-figure

The two women in this somber, unfinished painting were identified through preparatory drawings that label them as “Mme Lisle” (left) and “Mme Loubens” (right). Both were friends of artist Édouard Manet’s family; they likely met Degas at a gathering at Manet’s home.

Having worked in Rome before returning to Paris as first painter to Louis XIII in 1627, Vouet was a gifted teacher, attracting many students and collaborators to his Paris workshop. Vouet’s followers Charles Poërson, Michel Dorigny, and François Perrier have all suggested as the author of this painting.

Guillaumin encountered such scenes while working in security for a railroad company, a job that allowed him to travel and sketch in different places on the outskirts of the city.Guillaumin shared this interest in the Paris suburbs with his fellow Impressionists—especially Paul Cezanne and Camille Pissarro, with whom he painted in the 1870s.

He was also an enthusiastic balloonist, an obsession that led him to construct the largest hot air balloon the world had seen and make the first aerial photographs in 1858. Viewing the Earth’s surface from above, he wrote, “reduces all things to their relative proportions—to the Truth.” Nadar’s first flight aboard his balloon Géant (Giant) on October 4, 1863, was a great success. On the second launch, however, the balloon eventually crashed in Hanover, leaving Nadar with a fractured leg. This photograph of that launch establishes the sheer size of the balloon—which was made with 20,000 meters of silk and carried 80 passengers in a two-story basket—by juxtaposing it with the crowd of 200,000 who have come to watch it.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/92202/le-geant-champ-de-mars

Bernard carved the left panel and possibly the bottom panel. Both artists incorporated animals, trees, and people from village life in Brittany, France, motifs they also used in their paintings.

If conversation lagged, they invented games to spark the unconscious. The exquisite corpse grew out of one such invention, which reimagined the children’s game of “head, body, legs,” in which each participant adds to a drawing without seeing the preceding contributions, which are hidden by folding the paper. The results are strange, sometimes violent, combinations of images. The Surrealists produced many such drawings (the Art Institute has several; for example, 2018.333, 2018.334, and 2018.335), and these collaborative experiments were profoundly influential. The Chicago-based Hairy Who artists also played the game in the late 1960s, but with more playful results (for example, 2018.684, 2018.685, 2018.686, 2018.687, 2018.688, and 2018.689).",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/119118/exquisite-corpse

In it, Roger, a knight, rides a hippogriff to save Princess Angelica, who has been chained to a rock to be devoured by a sea monster. Antoine Louis Barye captured the moment the heroes take flight, leaving behind the defeated monster with waves lapping around it. This sculptural group formed part of a decorative ensemble for a fireplace mantel, which was commissioned around 1840 by Antoine, Duke of Montpensier, the youngest son of King Louis Philippe of France. The composition was recast frequently during and after Barye’s lifetime.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/102105/roger-and-angelica-mounted-on-the-hippogriff

He edited a number of reviews, published satirical and semi-porno­ graphic texts, and proclaimed that the writings of the Marquis de Sade would dominate the 20th century. In 1918, Apollinaire died from wounds he suffered during the First World War. His stature as a forerunner of Surre­alism continued to grow after his death, largely due to the intense eroticism and highly original verbal and typographical styles that are the hallmarks of his work (see his Calligrammes, Paris, 1918).",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/8718/portrait-of-guillaume-apollinaire

The two elegant saints are identifiable by their attributes: for Catherine, the wheel upon which she was tortured and the sword with which she was martyred; and for Barbara, the tower where her father locked her up to keep her safe from suitors. Saint Catherine also holds a ring, which the Christ Child in the Brussels panel reaches to grasp, thus indicating that their mystical union was the subject of the triptych. The tops of the two wings have been rounded off to mask their original function as moveable shutters to the left and right of the center panel.

They were sought after by a diverse clientele, ranging from royalty and courtiers to the upper middle class. In this work, one of his many self-portraits, Largillière presented himself as fashionably dressed and self-assured, the master of his art. He depicted himself as ready to lay out a painting, working with a porte-crayon (a piece of chalk in a holder) on the blank canvas behind him.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/69003/self-portrait

Moved by Japanese prints exhibited at the 1888 Exposition Internationale de Blanc et Noir and the 1889 Exposition Universelle, Lepére experimented with the color woodcut process. Breaking Waves pays homage to the ocean imagery popular in the islands of Japan and integrates a diagonally recessed shoreline with a horizon line just above the center elements that find a counterpart in Utagawa Hiroshige’s Hamamatsu.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/11311/breaking-waves-september-tide

Incredibly, ten other impressions of this stencil-colored, mass-produced Nativity survive, all also in boxes, and approximately one hundred other French coffers ornamented with similar prints exist. Their original purpose, however, remains uncertain. Despite their metal reinforcements and standardized lock, they were not sturdy enough to be strapped to pack animals. They may instead have been worn as backpacks, with the cushion on the bottom allowing the container to sit on the traveler’s knees for use as a movable shrine. A shallow secret compartment in the lid of this example is equally mysterious. It may have held contact relics, such as fabric or hair, or even consecrated Communion wafers, an unseen presence that would have reinforced the devotional value of the entire object.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/193362/the-nativity-in-coffer

Fra_706,Camille Silvy,Albumen print,The Day’s Orders (L’Ordre du Jour),"In this highly staged composition, which he nevertheless presented as a news photograph, Camille Silvy adapted a traditional genre painting for the depiction of a topical event. In May 1859, Emperor Napoleon III led the French Army into Italy to aid the controversial Italian unification movement (and secure the region of Nice for France). To rally French citizens behind his undertaking, the emperor sent his address to the frontline troops—the “Day’s Orders”—instantly by electric telegraph back to Paris, where it was printed overnight and posted in the streets. Silvy staged an image of the populace gathering before a poster; two of the men, who turn to face the camera, represent the intellectual and revolutionary factions opposed to the virtual police state that characterized Paris under the emperor’s reign. The following week, the newspaper L’Illustration printed a lithographic reproduction of the photograph, making this picture one of the earliest examples of photojournalism.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/205408/the-day-s-orders-l-ordre-du-jour

Starting with individual forms based on abstract drawings, he worked with a carpenter to cut amoeba-like shapes and then assembled them into composite structures that hold a hybrid position between painting and sculpture. The title, Manicured Relief, suggests that the top form’s gray-green extremities might represent painted fingernails, which became popular among women in the mid-1920s. The feminine association also carries over to the work’s first owner: Mary Reynolds, an artist and avant-garde bookbinder who, like Arp, was based in Paris in the 1930s.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/75375/manicured-relief

Eligius, his halo encircling his head, busily hammers out a golden disc on an anvil while his assistant mans the bellows. Dagobert, wearing a slender crown that Eligius may himself have wrought, gestures from the throne. The king was said to have valued the saint’s opinion over that of court nobles.Eligius was a famous goldsmith to Clothar II and to his successor, Dagobert I, before becoming a priest. For this reason, he was to become the patron saint of goldsmiths, blacksmiths, and farriers. Although Eligius (or Eloi) was a saint from ancient times, his cult attained its widest popularity in the later Middle Ages.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/4422/saint-eligius-and-king-dagobert

These prints highlight the ways he depicted space throughout a complete narrative. He framed each stage of the Passion of Christ with a different type of architectural or natural element. The porous boundaries of the exterior scenes allow visual movement by extending the view beyond the foreground figures, while the more rigorously contained interior scenes evoke a sense of finality. For example, Callot’s iconic image of the Last Supper takes place within an isolated triumphal arch that resembles an altar.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/8197/christ-carrying-the-cross-from-the-small-passion

Beginning in 1947, Dubuffet took three extended trips to the Sahara; based on the art and culture he experienced on these visits, he made a number of works, including The Grand Arab. In 1951 he developed a personal manifesto critiquing the conformity of Western society and delivered his “Anticultural Positions” in a lecture at the Arts Club of Chicago. He urged for a postwar renaissance: “The values celebrated by our culture do not … correspond to the true dynamics of our minds.” His presentation inspired many young artists and collectors in Chicago, who were eager to find new artistic forms that were distinct from the iconic European modernist tradition.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/145242/the-grand-arab-he-only-has-sand

Jean Chapuis’s 14th-century poem The Seven Articles of Faith explores the moral implications of Christ’s birth, baptism, death, descent into hell, resurrection, ascension, and second coming. Treated like a small panel painting rather than a decorated page, this image is characteristic of an accomplished illuminator called the Maitre François in its carefully rendered expressions and delicate use of minute stippling.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/5571/the-last-judgment-from-les-sept-articles-de-la-foi-by-jean-chappuis

Fra_788,André Masson,Graphite and colored crayons on ivory wove paper,Exquisite Corpse,"The so-called cadavre exquis or exquisite corpse, a Surrealist visual game, was created in winter 1925–26, when members of the group gathered in the evenings. If conversation lagged, they invented games to spark the unconscious. The exquisite corpse grew out of one such invention, which reimagined the children’s game of “head, body, legs,” in which each participant adds to a drawing without seeing the preceding contributions, which are hidden by folding the paper. The results are strange, sometimes violent, combinations of images. The Surrealists produced many such drawings (the Art Institute has several; for example, 2018.333, 2018.334, and 2018.335), and these collaborative experiments were profoundly influential. The Chicago-based Hairy Who artists also played the game in the late 1960s, but with more playful results (for example, 2018.684, 2018.685, 2018.686, 2018.687, 2018.688, and 2018.689).",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/119116/exquisite-corpse

Her perch on the crescent moon sets her in unflinching opposition to the seven-headed dragon opposite, and the glory of the sun’s rays emitted by her helps keep it at bay. Her charge, the infant Christ, has already been borne aloft to God the Father by angels, ensuring the salvation of humanity.

Color lithography was used both for posters and for smaller prints or portfolios that could be purchased by a growing market of middle-class private collectors. Toulouse-Lautrec designed this cover for the first issue of L’Estampe originale, a quarterly portfolio that included prints by the era’s leading artists.

Previously attributed to the French Mannerist sculptor Germain Pilon (1535–1590), it currently bears an attribution to Pietro Tacca, court sculptor to the Medici grand dukes in the first half of the 17th century.

One critic, Octave Mirbeau, wrote that the works conveyed “the drama of the earth.” Since Monet rarely made drawings, this sheet may have been a potential illustration for Mirbeau’s article.

Destitute and distraught over a thwarted love, he hung himself from a lantern post in 1855. Gustave Doré’s lithograph provides a fitting pictorial memorial to the poet’s hallucinatory vision and tragic end. Never pulled in an edition, the lithograph is very rare; it marks the culmination of Doré’s work in the medium.

In a process that became known as Haussmannization, many of Paris’s narrow medieval streets were demolished in order to make room for the wide boulevards and public parks for which it is now known. The city commissioned Marville to photograph the areas slated for destruction as well as the modern amenities, such as gas lighting and commercial kiosks, that would become fixtures of the new urban landscape. With a corpus of more than 400 photographs, Marville produced a remarkable document of Paris in a time of epochal transition.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/181558/rue-de-la-montagne-sainte-genevieve-near-the-intersection-of-rue-laplace-rue-de-la-montagne-sainte-genevieve-pres-de-carrefour-de-la-rue-laplace

Fra_944,Gustave Le Gray,"Albumen print, No. 16 from the album ""Vistas del Mar""","Cloudy Sky, Mediterranean Sea","Trained in Paris as an academic painter, Gustave Le Gray gained renown for his revolutionary process of photographing seascapes. Because of technical limitations, photography could not satisfactorily depict sky and sea simultaneously; in a single image, the sky would appear washed-out, while the water looked too dark. Le Gray resolved this shortcoming by combining two negatives (one for sea and one for sky) made at different exposure times. Although this solution represented a manipulation of photographic technique, rather than being understood as duplicitous, it was seen as an expansion of the medium’s possibilities. Looking back at the most significant accomplishments in photography of 1857–58, Marc-Antoine Gaudin, a critic for the journal La Lumière, proclaimed Le Grey’s seascapes “the event of the year.” This photograph was originally bound with others in a single album, Vistas del Mar, comprising an extremely rare collection of these seascapes.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/126485/cloudy-sky-mediterranean-sea

The tureen was produced for Count Alexander Sergeyevitch Stroganov, Russian ambassador to London and Naples and a renowned collector and patron of the arts. Like most Russian nobles, Count Alexander loved French culture and commissioned luxurious objects from Parisian craftsmen. Only one other piece from this dinner service is known to have survived. Beef Stroganoff must have been named for a later member of the family as the recipe first appears in a cookbook only in 1861.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/8578/tureen-and-stand

Barye and Delacroix also spent time drawing animals from life at the Jardin des Plantes.

In this brilliant impression, the primal fear of a threatened wild beast is expressed with particular drama. Here we see the quintessential Delacroix, who, as the poet Charles Baudelaire wrote, “was passionately in love with passion and coldly determined to seek the means of expressing it.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/74127/wild-horse-or-frightened-horse-leaving-the-water

In its laser-like focus on one cavalry soldier and his charging horse in the heat of battle, this drawing’s romantic intensity departs radically from the Classical restraint of many works of the period.Géricault exoticized his horseman, giving him African features and clothing him in the garb of an Ottoman mamluk, a caste of Muslim slave soldiers who fought for their indepe-dence in Egypt in the early 1800s. The artist was politically progressive for his time and championed the cause of liberty with this image.

A founder of Magnum, a cooperative photographic agency formed in 1947 to give photographers creative control over their own images, Cartier-Bresson traveled the world as a photojournalist. The Art Institute acquired seven of his photographs in 1962, including this image of children playing beside the Seine, precisely framed and divided by gravel, pathways, and shrubs. Edwards later wrote in a letter: “There are many great photographs by Cartier-Bresson, but this always remains my favorite.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/13799/juvisy-france

Seen as part of a European imperialist campaign, Maximilian’s rule was considered illegitimate by those who opposed the French occupation of Mexico. This work interprets the young ruler’s execution in Querétero, Mexico, on June 19, 1867, alongside generals Miguel Miramón (left) and Tomás Mejía (right). Édouard Manet’s composition was inspired by not only history painting and the iconography of Francisco de Goya but also contemporary journalism and the budding field of newspaper photography. One controversial aspect of this print is the presence of French troops in the firing squad rather than those of the Mexican Republic. The lithograph was censored by the French government and was not publicly printed until after Manet’s death.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/13563/the-execution-of-maximilian

Fra_1140,Germaine Richier,Bronze,Man of the Night,"This work is often referred to as large Man of the Night, probably to distinguish it from a closely related, but smaller version (see Chicago, Allan Frumkin Gallery, The Sculpture of Germaine Richier: First American Exhibition, 1954, exh. cat., no. 19 (ill.), as Man of the Night). The sculpture seems originally to have been simply called Man of the Night; the qualification “large” first appeared in parentheses, following the title, in the 1959 exhibition at the Musée Grimaldi, Chateau d’Antibes, the first major retrospective of Richier’s work to follow her death earlier that year. It would seem, therefore, that this qualification should not be considered an integral element of the title. Three other, smaller sculptures, bearing the same title and date as the Bergman cast are recorded in the catalogue of a recent retrospective (see Paris 1996, p. 207, nos. 65–68). The ones reproduced (nos. 65 and 67) are of a distinctly different design.During the 1950s, Richier created various hybrids by “crossing human species with other organisms, animal and vegetable” (David Sylvester, “On Germaine Richier,” in London, Hanover Gallery, Germaine Richier, 1955, exh. cat., n. pag.). Sylvester perceived these sculptures as an assault on the human body, a test of what it can endure and still remain human. As Sylvester noted, “for Richier the assertion of the human image does not depend on creating…fine, noble effigies of unadulterated man. For her, the assertion of the human image is achieved through its denial. Hers is a human image challenged, battered, ruined, and still obstinately human” (ibid.). Paul Guth’s description of Man of the Night in his studio interview with Richier, draws attention, moreover, to another kind of tension in this work, between the figure’s winged and earthbound qualities: “We come to The Man of the Night. He has a bat’s head, triangle-shape. Stumps of wings rise from his back. He grips the earth with leaden paws. He has to! If he hadn’t such heavy paws his wings would bear him aloft” (Guth 1957–58, p. 82).Here the most human aspects of the figure are the lower part of the body and its heavy, lumpen limbs. The tension between the figure’s lower half and the raised wings may refer to the struggle to remain “human,” to which Sylvester alluded, and which characterized an anxious postwar Europe. The wings, which we might at first associate with the elevated and aspiring in man, are upon further observation clearly those of a bat and, like the head, the least rather than the most human aspect of the figure. Furthermore, the outspread wings here recall the image that, in Western tradition, symbolizes human sacrifice and divine redemption most vividly: the Crucifixion. Finally, the entire surface of the sculpture is scarred by a web of interlocking, incised lines, an effect Richier possibly derived from her drawing technique of this period (see Paris 1996, pp. 198–99, nos. 118–19, ills.). In Man of the Night, Richier suggested that there is no simple opposition between the base and the elevated, the earthbound and the heavenly, the human and the animal.— Entry, Dawn Ades, Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1997, p. 220–21.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/118734/man-of-the-night

On one such occasion, in the company of Gustave Moreau, the young Degas made this study. The two artists depicted the same nude, but from different vantage points. Degas dated his study “1857 ”speculatively, many years later, but Moreau recorded “1858” at the time. The model’s dramatic pose—raised arm, eyes turned heavenward—was in keeping with the large-scale paintings favored by the French state in the 1850s. These tended to show heroic subject matter; the figure here could have been a potential prototype for a multifigure composition.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/185909/study-of-a-male-nude

In 1851 the French government selected him as one of five photographers to document the nation’s architectural heritage, a survey known as the Missions Héliographiques. The images Baldus produced for the project exhibited such technical prowess that he won support for another project, Les villes de France photographiées, designed to revive interest in the nation’s Roman and medieval history. During the summer of 1854, Baldus traveled in the Auvergne region of central France, making pictures that emphasize the drama of the natural landscape, such as this river scene. Although the large-format waxed paper negatives he employed were never intended to be exhibited, they remain compelling objects that offer up a startling range of tones.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/188835/untitled

Fra_1285,Jean Henri Riesener (Cabinetmaker),"Oak, mahogany, marble, and gilt-bronze mounts",Corner Cabinet,"This corner was one of four made for the dining room of Marie Antoinette’s private retreat, which was built within the Petit Trianon complex on the grounds of Versailles. The retreat, a cluster of picturesque buildings including a mill, dairy and working farm, was known as Le Hameau, or The Hamlet. The marks painted and impressed on top of the cabinet, underneath the marble slab, indicate that it was made for the French queen.In keeping with the back-to-nature movement in vogue during the 1780s, Marie Antoinette commissioned this village, whose deliberately distressed buildings with quaint thatched roofs belied the luxurious furnishings often contained within. This retreat into a make-believe world of simple pleasures gave the queen the opportunity to escape from the rigid protocol of French court life with her closest friends.The corner cabinet, with its imported mahogany veneers, marble top, and jewel-like gilt-bronze mounts, was designed by Jean-Henri Riesener (1734–1806), the most important cabinetmaker working in Paris at the time. Like many others in his field, Riesener was of German origin. He specialized in sophisticated marquetry and an interpretation of the fashionable Neoclassical style that had become increasingly delicate by the time this cupboard was made. The horizontal gilt-bronze border of semi-recumbent infants and leafy garlands below the marble top are especially finely cast.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/96539/corner-cabinet

Fra_1294,Maison Alphonse Giroux (Manufacturer),"Rosewood, ivory, gilt bronze, brass, and pewter",Work Table,"The innovative marquetry technique displayed on this work table, was patented in 1877 by Rosalie Duvinage, also called Veuve (Widow) Duvinage. She was the owner of Maison Giroux, a Paris firm that had produced a wide assortment of luxury goods for generations. In this mosaic technique, pieces of ivory were held fast within a matrix of engraved metal strips and different woods were inlaid to create complex patterns. Here the ivory ground is separated by a network of engraved brass and pewter that forms the branches and leaves of a flowering peony bush, within which rests a large pheasant. Different wood inlays reveal the contour and shading of both plant and bird.The decoration of this table was inspired by the flood of imports coming from Asia, especially from China and Japan, to Europe in the second half of the 19th century. Images of flowers and animals that were originally Chinese were adapted by Japanese craftsmen for furniture and finally translated onto objects in Europe. The artists of Maison Giroux appear to have had a firm grasp on the symbolic language of Asia: according to custom, tree peonies represent the male principle yang, and the golden pheasant (a traditional symbol of feminine beauty) symbolizes yin, its natural complement.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/144991/work-table

To achieve a swelling line akin to an engraving, bosse utilized an instrument called an ‘échoppe’, a beveled etching needle, which he could twist in the ground to create variable widths of etched line, similar to the work of Jacques Callot.

He termed them X-rays, and news of the discovery spread rapidly. For the scientific community, X-rays expanded medical possibilities, allowing doctors to see interior anatomy without surgery. For the general public, these pictures spectacularly revealed places normally invisible to the human eye and became objects of enduring fascination. This X-ray appeared on the cover of Les Rayons X, a journal of radiology, on March 5, 1898, just two years after Röntgen’s discovery. The accompanying article claimed that X-rays were “interesting and useful for the study of fetal development at all stages of pregnancy,” describing in wonderment what can be seen clearly in the image (larger bones and the spine) and what cannot (connective tissue and cartilage).",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/147149/degree-of-ossification-of-a-five-month-old-fetus-degre-d-ossification-d-un-foetus-de-cinq-mois

Édouard Vuillard is best known today for his depictions of Parisian interiors, often populated by his friends and family. At the time Landscapes and Interiors was published, however, collectors were not eager to purchase the series, perhaps due to its personal and private subject matter; 20 years after it was produced, the influential art dealer Ambroise Vollard had not yet sold the edition of 100.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/22744/the-cook-plate-eleven-from-landscapes-and-interiors

The lyre suggests that the lithograph should be interpreted as an image of the young love of Orpheus, son of Apollo, and his muse, Eurydice, whose affectionate playfulness keeps him from practicing his music.

Early in his career, Massine collaborated with Jean Cocteau, Erik Satie and Pablo Picasso on the 1917 ballet Parade; he worked in the same year with Leon Bakst, who designed his Les femmes de bonne humeur. One of Massine’ s enduring successes, La boutique fantasque, dates from 1919. Bakst made the first designs, exhibited here, for the set and costumes for this ballet, but they were rejected by Diaghilev who chose Andre Derain to complete the project.

The Soundstation radio is one of designer Matali Crasset’s early projects, produced with Philippe Starck for Thompson Multimedia. The distinctive shape of this compact clock radio departs from conventional models, with a cone-shaped speaker intended to visualize a blast of sound while also recalling the nostalgic form of the gramophone horn. Crasset’s design follows many early innovators in the 1920s and 40s who helped popularize audio equipment for the individual consumer, such as architect and industrial designer Henry Glass’s distinctive designs for the Fada Radio Company.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/189806/soundstation-radio-alarm-clock

The rich range of greens creates a velvet-like effect. Earth tones differentiate the undulating hills. The paper support, though discolored from pink to tan, still lends a sense of warmth. The pastel on this sheet covers a unique printed image made by the artist. Degas produced many color monotypes in this period.

Adapting Rubens’s heroic figures and penchant for mythological themes to a smaller scale for private collectors, he excelled at carving delicate, playful reliefs showing the followers of Bacchus, the Roman god of wine, in marble and in ivory.

The artist used eight different colors for these segments: black, white, yellow, orange, red, violet, blue, and green. Each bar contains at least three and at most seven colors; this work has four colors across 52 segments. Cadere developed his barres de bois rond as mobile works of art that could be carried in his hand as a staff or positioned in a carefully chosen space. Seeking to question art-world hierarchies, Cadere placed his wooden bars in both art and nonart venues, either with or without permission.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/207847/untitled-baton-de-darthea

Their popularity spawned innovations in printmaking, unrivaled in technical sophistication, to create both original and reproductive prints that looked like drawings and satisfied the needs of the market. Roulettes and mattoirs, handheld tools with a cluster of fine-toothed ends, were devised to punch notches in metal plates so that, when inked and printed, the marks imitated the look of crumbly chalk on textured paper.

Boiffard was at the heart of the early movement: mentioned by Breton in the first Surrealist Manifesto (1924), he also contributed to the inaugural issue of La Révolution surréaliste the same year, assisted Man Ray in his studio, and took pictures of Paris to illustrate Breton’s book Nadja in 1928. He caught the attention of collector and dealer Julien Levy, who purchased three of Boiffard’s photographs in 1931 and included him—with Eugène Atget, Man Ray, László Moholy-Nagy, Salvador Dalí, and Pablo Picasso, among others—in his gallery exhibition Surréalisme in January 1932.

A work of unbridled propaganda, the drawing is also a call for Napoleon to support the arts.Prud’hon’s idiosyncratic style blends a frieze-like arrangement of figures and overt references to ancient Rome (hallmarks of the period’s classicizing tendencies) with a soft sensuality inspired by Leonardo da Vinci and other Italian Renaissance masters.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/151457/the-triumph-of-bonaparte

The artist created an iconic portrait of the singer that reduced his likeness to its most memorable elements: a wide-brimmed hat, black cloak, and bright-red scarf.

It had been acquired for the richest man in America, the railroad magnate William H. Vanderbilt, whose wealth was then estimated at $200 million (about $40 billion in today’s money), and whose lavish mansion was then under construction at 640 Fifth Avenue. Most of the furnishings for the Vanderbilt home were made by Herter Brothers, America’s leading interior decorators, but selected works of art, including this clock, were imported from abroad. Vanderbilt only got to enjoy his opulent home for three years before his death in 1885.The clock was a central adornment for the Japanese Parlor, one of the most elaborate and exotic interiors made by Herter Brothers. The room deliberately contrasted with the rest of the interiors, which were firmly rooted in European historical styles. Although dubbed a “Japanese” clock, many of the decorations are actually interpretations of Chinese motifs: the dragons in bronze and cloisonné (inlaid enamel) are traditional Chinese symbols of good fortune, and the numbers on the clock face are Chinese.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/194394/wall-clock

His drawings established him as one of the most influential draftsmen of his time, a bridge between the romantics and the symbolists. It is the large-scale abstract works, such as this drawing, broadly handled, unclear, brooding, and mysterious, which are Hugo’s greatest legacy. This particular drawing was obviously highly prized by Hugo; only his major works received lengthy dedications, and this drawing is inscribed on both the mat and frame.

Jean-Baptiste Greuze in particular capitalized on this cult of feeling.The Paternal Blessing was an illustration for a pictorial narrative by Greuze called Bazile and Thibault, or The Two Educations. It told the story of two brothers, one good and one bad. Reflecting theories of nature versus nurture espoused by the philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712–78), Bazile became a good man because he had been breast-fed as an infant at home, while Thibault became a bad man because he had been sent away to a wet nurse.

Despite its antiestablishment reputation, Bruant’s cabaret, Le Mirliton, attracted patrons from a wide variety of backgrounds—even upper-class Parisians, who came expecting Bruant to openly ridicule them during and after the shows.In 1892 Bruant commissioned Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec to design a poster advertising his performances at the upscale Ambassadeurs and Eldorado clubs. The artist created an iconic portrait of the singer that reduced his likeness to its most memorable elements: a wide-brimmed hat, black cloak, and bright-red scarf. Over time Toulouse-Lautrec reused and adapted this unmistakable image in many different designs to publicize Bruant’s shows at Le Mirliton.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/67172/aristide-bruant-in-his-cabaret

It has been identified as a study for Vuillard’ s 1892 submission to the Livre d’ Art, the illustrated periodical published by Paul Fort, founder of Theatre d’ Art, the first forum for symbolist theater. Vuillard creates his image with a brilliant economy of means. A single line evokes the parted curtain-both a literal element of stagecraft and an emblem for theater itself. In addition, the line of the curtain cuts the page and calls attention to the flat surface of the drawing.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/70211/at-the-theatre

He then turned his attention to landscapes, and over the course of the 1860s produced large-scale commercial views as well as thousands of stereographs focusing on fashionable tourist destinations in Germany and Switzerland. (One observer claimed in 1866 that it was virtually impossible to take a step in Switzerland without stumbling upon a shop selling Braun’s prints and stereo views.) It is unknown, however, whether this three-part triptych—including two figures repeated in each frame—was intended for tourist consumption.

The artist, violently opposed to the careful linear styles espoused by the Royal Academy (as represented by Jean-August-Dominique Ingres and Jacques-Louis David), not only drew his animal prints directly onto the lithographic stone, but also clawed and scraped into them to create further highlights. This Orientalizing print was made twelve years after a seven-month journey through Spain, Morocco, and Algeria and was likely inspired by a combination of memory, imagination, and examination of the Barbary lions at the zoo in Paris’s Jardin des Plantes.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/22905/lion-devouring-a-horse

Although Degas lived in the family house for the spring and summer of 1859, this is the only known formal portrait of his father from those early years. Stylistically, the work owes much to the restrained draftsmanship of Ingres, whom Degas met and admired in his student days.

Her stage and film acting career spanned six decades and multiple continents. She also produced and directed plays, and from 1893 to 1899 she helmed the Paris Renaissance Theater, where she starred in a production of Jean Racine’s Phèdre, as pictured here. Her personal life was hardly less dramatic. One of her trademarks was sleeping (and reportedly, receiving suitors) in a satin-lined, rosewood coffin.

Brassaï also made pictures in the light of day. He might have taken this photograph while vacationing in the coastal French town, Loctudy, near Brittany. In a letter to his parents dated September 18, 1931, he mentions spending time there with a young woman named Jeannine.

The work was first exhibited in the state-sponsored Salon of 1861 under the title Abd el-Kader aiding a Christian, in reference to the Muslim hero who personally saved thousands of Christians from Syrian aggression in 1860. While the event surely parallels the biblical tale, Bresdin probably alluded to the well-known contemporary figure of Abd el-Kader as a means to popularize his own religious imagery. Indeed, the print was so well received that it was published in a series of editions, at such profit to the artist that he later referred to the print as “my good Samaritan.” This proof was printed early in the first edition, before the lithographic stone began to deteriorate, and is one of the most crisp and successful existing impressions of the print.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/109503/the-good-samaritan

In the background a sculpted bust of Voltaire is wreathed, a ceremony enacted on Paris stages after the writer’s 1778 death. The print was likely made around 1791 to celebrate Voltaire’s re-burial inside the Paris Panthéon, a repurposed church designed after the ancient Roman Pantheon (here described as the Temple of Memory). Voltaire himself owned the original painting of this subject by the same amateur artist who created this print.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/148554/le-triomphe-de-voltaire

This image features the hands of poet Paul Valéry—with whom Albin-Guillot collaborated on books of photographs and poetry—as he writes with an inky flourish. This print was produced through the Fresson process beloved of Pictorialists; its secrets are closely guarded by the Fresson family, who manufactured the paper and printed the images.

Fra_2411,Philippe Parreno,Mylar; edition number two of three with two artist's proofs,My Room is Another Fish Bowl,"Philippe Parreno creates spaces that allow us to speculate about alternate worlds and states of being. My Room Is Another Fish Bowl is an immersive installation which explores how objects and environmental factors left to chance actively shape human behavior and the perception of the passage of time.The work consists of helium-filled fish shapes that have been delicately weighted to float at different heights. Circulating around these floating objects, the visitors have an experience that may be equated or contrasted with that of the fish moving aimlessly within the gallery. In art and words, Parreno has frequently proposed the exhibition as a film without a camera. Here he casts museumgoers to move in a carefully staged gallery space. The fish move with the gallery’s air currents, visitors enter and exit, and natural light from adjacent windows shifts continually according to the weather and time of day. No two individuals’ experience of the space will be identical, nor will the ever-changing installation configuration repeat itself. The drifting Mylar forms and the museum visitors act upon and define each other, rendering both groups neither purely social nor wholly natural.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/236362/my-room-is-another-fish-bowl

The ballet Liberation of Tirreno and Arnea was a symbol of opulence, celebrating the 1616 wedding of the Duke of Mantua, Ferdinando Gonzaga, and Cosimo II’s sister, Caterina de’ Medici. In this scene, heavy drapery is cast aside to reveal the intermezzo, or staged entertainment between acts. The ballet dancers have moved from the stage to the auditorium floor, drawing the Duke and Archduchess themselves into the dance. Callot depicted the interior space of the famous Uffizi Theater, which is the only known visual record of the building. Nonetheless, Callot tended to exaggerate grandeur and vastness in performance imagery, which makes gauging its realism challenging.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/96185/first-intermezzo-of-the-veglia-of-the-liberation-of-tyrsenus-and-arnea

Though dimmed by brief and disenchanting military service (1815) and the disappointments of the Napoleonic era, he found in lithography an appropriate match for his awareness of the politics of contemporary France. While crossing the Tuileries gardens outside of the Musée du Louvre, a peg-legged French veteran at left confronts a sentry of the Swiss Royal Guard. When the Swiss officer moves to take up his musket, the veteran exposes the Napoleonic cross pinned to his chest, beneath his coat. Despite old age and handicap, the Napoleonic soldier gives a gesture of defiance, thus communicating patriotic pride during a postempiric period.

Softly layering multiple chalk-manner plates in colored inks, he completed the images with gold-leaf-accented frames. As the use of gold leaf was strictly regulated in France, Bonnet created an elaborate ruse: the English titles, sometimes misspelled, and printer’s address on the paper frame suggest that these prints were published in London, not Paris.

The emperor asked Le Gray to document the newly inaugurated Camp de Châlons, a vast military training ground for 25,000 troops and 6,000 horses. Le Gray’s results were edited and collated into a series of presentation albums offered by Napoléon III to the principal officers participating in exercises held at the camp (this print is drawn from one such album). Unfazed by lengthy exposure times or the immensity of his subject, Le Gray displayed a characteristic sensitivity to composition and light. In this photograph, a mounted officer and a soldier in a bearskin cap are visible in the foreground, but the line of troops receding into the haze suggests the presence of unseen multitudes.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/144430/chalons-encampment-maneuvers-on-october-3-camp-de-chalons-manoeuvres-du-3-octobre

The play had gained considerable popularity in France by 1844. Though little is known of the specifics of this particular commission, it was a project that captivated Théodore Chassériau for years. These two prints, from Chassériau’s series of 15 plates, illustrate the emotional crescendo of Desdemona and Othello’s relationship. Plate 9 tenderly represents Desdemona’s despair when she sings the Willow Song. Her words—“Let nobody blame him; his scorn I approve”—are prophetic. Later, convinced of her infidelity, Othello smothers her with a pillow. Plate 14 shows the moment Emilia tells Othello of Desdemona’s innocence and Iago’s treachery. Chassériau’s use of gesture links the three central characters in a dramatic pyramidal composition that conveys the poignant meaning of the scene.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/84466/the-willow-song-plate-nine-from-othello

Fra_2638,Jacques Louis David,"Brush and gray washes, over graphite, on ivory laid paper",Villa in the Campagna,"After several unsuccessful attempts, Jacques-Louis David finally won the highly coveted Prix de Rome in 1774. The award subsidized his first trip to the city in 1775 to study Classical art and architecture, a necessity for any ambitious painter of the period. Over the next five years, David absorbed and recorded everything he saw in hundreds of drawings, principally in black chalk, sometimes heightened with wash. He copied ancient Greek and Roman art as well as work by Old Masters such as Raphael, Correggio, and Michelangelo, and he studied the architecture and landscape of Rome and its surrounding area (often called la campagna, or the countryside). After his return to France, he assembled these sheets into two albums, which his sons, Eugène and Jules, later divided into twelve parts. The present sheet comes from the tenth album, which remained with David’s heirs until the 1950s.That David preserved the sketches from his Italian sojourn suggests the important role they played in his oeuvre, serving as a kind of visual encyclopedia of motifs and ideas. This sheet, like his other Italian sketches, fueled and invigorated David’s mature artistic production, underpinning the evolution of his signature Neoclassical style.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/149045/villa-in-the-campagna

The British artist George Stubbs (1724–1806) was a likely inspiration for these works, as his printed portraits of horses in dark settings and bleak situations were well known in France. Delacroix’s sizable, atmospheric lithograph leaves much to the viewer’s imagination. We cannot see the reason for the horse’s fright, but feel its powerful urge to escape. This chilling image touches on all the hallmarks of the Romantic movement and reflects Delacroix’s preoccupation with images of suffering, insanity, violence, and imminent death.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/100822/wild-horse-or-frightened-horse-leaving-the-water

The clearest object is the moon, represented by a curve of unmarked paper, in stark contrast with the heavily shaded image. The moon’s prominence only deepens the print’s irony: a crescent moon is traditionally a symbol that a husband has been cuckolded by his wife, suggesting that the man in the print cannot see what is right before his eyes.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/21550/sight-plate-39-from-types-parisiens

His studies of the architecture, landscapes, and people of Algeria—which France had invaded in 1830—tapped into a public fascination with Orientalist depictions of the Middle East and North Africa. De Beaucorps employed paper negatives, then the preferred technology for photographing architecture. Because enlarging was not yet practicable (prints were made by contact with the negative in direct sunlight), photographer-voyagers required cameras as large as the pictures they wished to make. Although this paper negative does not represent the image’s final presentation, it reveals the intricate patterning of Moorish architecture in reverse. A member of the French Photographic Society, de Beaucorps exhibited his prints of Algeria in Paris in 1859, 1861, and 1869.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/154271/palace-algeria

Fra_2831,Hippolyte Bayard,Salted paper print,Moulin de la Galette (Montmartre),"The invention of photography was announced to the world in France (by Joseph Nicéphore Niépce and his partner, Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre) and in England (by William Henry Fox Talbot) in 1839. At the same time, however, Hippolyte Bayard was conducting his own photographic experiments. Now recognized as one of the inventors of photography, Bayard held the first photographic exhibition in the world (also in 1839), and continued to photograph and promote photography in France for several decades. This is one of a series of pictures Bayard made of the windmills of Montmartre, at the time still a village but soon to be swallowed into greater Paris. In the early 19th century this windmill housed a business selling galettes, a kind of French pastry. Later it comprised a legendary cabaret and was depicted in paintings by Renoir, Van Gogh, Lautrec, and others. Because of its heightened sensitivity to light, this early photograph must be kept under a shade while on view.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/206652/moulin-de-la-galette-montmartre

He released a catalogue detailing 187 different images from the collection, including this image of half-armor bearing the insignia of King Philip III.

Bosse drew a parallel between this depiction and the portrayal of Alexander the Great’s mistress by the ancient artist Apelles, who is depicted above the painter. According to legend, the resulting work was so exquisite that Alexander gave his mistress to Apelles, who was in love with her, but kept her portrait himself.

Rousseau often used flowers in his work for their symbolic meanings. He was particularly fond of daisies, which traditionally represent innocence and purity.

At court he documented lavish events through his prints such as The Marriage. Here a distinguished group of spectators witnesses the marriage of Ferdinand de’ Medici and Duchess Christine. In contrast to Callot’s usual medium of etching, The Marriage was executed as an engraving.

With his singular style of engraving, Claude Mellan employed parallel lines, rather than cross-hatching, to create shading. This technique is visible on Talon’s cap, where Mellan thickened and darkened portions of the lines around its center to suggest a dark fabric lit from above. Since this style leaves more of the paper untouched by ink, Mellan’s engravings are often lighter than works by his contemporaries.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/41711/omer-talon

Successful before World War I as a purveyor of “Old Paris” to libraries and artists, in his final years (and posthumously) he became a cult favorite of two specific and influential sets—European Surrealists and American documentarians. Atget included this early image of a cabaret in a 1913 album of 60 images called Signs and Old Shops in Paris. He focused here equally on the emblem of “the armed man”—a title (and a tavern) dating to the medieval crusades, rendered in word and image to assure its familiarity to a partially illiterate clientele—and on the maitre d’, who gazes back through a glass window that also reflects, like a ghost, the likeness of the photographer himself.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/223184/cabaret-de-l-homme-arme-rue-des-blancs-manteaux

Descourtis learned his method of multiple-plate color printing from Jean François Janinet and like him used toolwork on the plate rather than aquatint, an acid immersion process used to create general areas of shading.In this print, Virginie decides to return home to Mauritius after several miserable years in Paris, where she has agonized over her separation from Paul. However, a typhoon strikes her ship within sight of the island. In line with 18th-century French ideals of virtue in women, she refuses to remove her clothing and swim to safety in front of the sailors, and so she drowns in the shipwreck. Her body is eventually found amid debris washed up on the shore, and Domingue and the narrator discover that she kept a locket with a portrait of Paul close to her, even until her death.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/28750/finding-virginie-s-body-plate-5-from-paul-et-virginie

He traveled to Jersualem in 1853, photographing holy sites for a year, until he was stricken by fever and forced to return home with some 150 paper negatives. The resulting prints were published in 1856 by the noted printer Louis-Désiré Blanquart-Evrard as a tourist album on the monuments of Jerusalem, available for purchase by the public; in the introduction, Salzmann wrote, “Photographs are not reports, but rather conclusive brute facts.” Despite this assertion, his choice of medium did act as a vehicle of interpretation: the salted paper print gave a somewhat softened, textured appearance to the stone ruins, increasing the suggestion of nostalgia latent in the combination of archeology and tourism.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/60084/jerusalem-valley-of-josaphat-tomb-of-st-james-jerusalem-vallee-de-josaphat-tombeau-de-saint-jacques

This drawing was made for the erstwhile cleric and avid printmaker Abbé de Saint-Non, who commissioned Fragonard to make copies after important Old Master paintings in Italy. The original painting (now in the National Gallery, London) hung in the Palazzo Borghese in Rome when the two artists visited it in late 1760 or early 1761.

Pinioned by the lion’s mighty paws, the man no longer struggles but resigns himself to being rent asunder. The man’s eyes are in shadow while the animal’s are wide and fierce, a contrast underscoring the violence and the intimacy of the kill.

In the center forefront Saint Sebastian, usually portrayed with multiple lacerations from arrows, is shown without visible wounds. Saint Roch, on the right with the dog that rescued him offering bread, lifts his tunic to show the buboes on his thigh are gone. Saint Anthony died from ergotism, a sickness with gangrene-like symptoms that blackens the skin and is now commonly called Saint Anthony’s fire.

Thus, he embraced the invention of lithography in the late 18th century as an opportunity to become the master of a new medium. In lithography a grease crayon was used to draw on a smooth stone, a process more similar to painting and drawing than other forms of printmaking. The development of Géricault’s work mirrors the exploration of lithography’s possibilities; here, for example, the artist experimented with the use of subtle contrast.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/121981/entrance-to-the-adelphi-wharf-plate-11-from-various-subjects-drawn-from-life-on-stone

Originally trained as a civil engineer, he offered his services to the French Academy of Sciences in 1851, and by the end of that year he had set sail southward on the Nile. Between 1851 and 1852, Teynard made an extensive record of the Nile valley, ultimately producing 160 salted paper prints covering one thousand miles on the river. This photograph shows, along with hieroglyphics, a stone inscription made in March 1799 by Napoleonic troops after their defeat of local Egyptian forces. Others, presumably locals as well, had subsequently defaced the monument, and a French traveler had added one last layer of commentary before Teynard’s picture, incising in colonialist reply: “A PAGE OF HISTORY SHOULD NOT BE SULLIED.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/144599/first-pylon-french-inscription-carved-on-the-eastern-embrasure-at-point-h-island-of-fila-philae

Both series use the simple power of the etched line to suggest volume and movement. In the case of Matisse, he avoided heavy shading so as not to detract from the ethereality of Mallarmé’s poetry.

His seascapes, which were publicly exhibited in London and Paris in 1857 to great acclaim, displayed his technical mastery: he combined two negatives—one exposed for the sea, the other for the sky—to render a scene otherwise unable to be captured photographically. Moreover, Le Gray managed to arrest a breaking wave in this dramatic vertical image, an accomplishment almost unheard of at a time when exposures required several seconds.

He also sold photographs as models for students of industrial design; French art schools sought to improve their training programs in applied arts and design to gain a competitive edge in the increasingly industrialized market for wallpaper and fabrics. Declining demand for naturalistic-pattern designs, however, together with the art establishment’s anxiety over the increased status of photography, brought a halt to sales in the 1870s, and Aubry died bankrupt and relatively obscure.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/54692/untitled

Fra_3428,Jean Cocteau,Graphite with smudging on ivory wove paper,Nightmare (Cauchemar),"Cocteau is best known for his work as a writer and film director. He received his earliest notoriety for the 1917 ballet, Parade, that he produced for Diaghilev, with choreography by Leonide Massine, sets by Pablo Picasso, and music by Erik Satie. It was for this work that Guillaume Apollinaire, writing critically, coined the prophetic term “surreal.” Cocteau saw himself as the invisible man who made the invisible world visible. Nightmare is clearly an image drawn from the subconscious, a condition that was exaggerated by Cocteau’s addiction to opium, a drug he began using to abate his depression after the death in 1923 of his protege, the young novelist Raymond Radiguet. In Nightmare the dismembered hand and its exaggerated size bespeak the effect of opium on a keen and alert intellect in agony. The artist described these violently expressive drawings as “screams of suffering in slow motion.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/142538/nightmare-cauchemar

He gained acclaim in London in 1856 for a series of large-scale, technically accomplished seascapes made on the Normandy coastline. This photograph belongs to a series made the following year in the Mediterranean coast city of Sète, where Le Gray was on assignment to document a new train station. He positioned himself on the jetty that separated the port from the sea to make this photograph of the two-stacked steamship Saïd leading other vessels at anchor in the harbor. Another version of the same scene, made from the city side of the harbor, was reproduced as an engraving and published in Le Monde illustré in May of 1857.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/126480/the-port-and-city-of-sete-mediterranean-port-et-ville-de-sete-mediterranee

Fra_3464,Henri Cartier-Bresson,Gelatin silver print,"Córdoba, Spain","A defining figure of photographic modernism, Henri Cartier-Bresson used a handheld camera to snatch beguiling images from fleeting moments of everyday life. In his 1952 book, The Decisive Moment, he explained, “I prowled the streets all day, feeling very strung-up and ready to pounce, determined to ‘trap’ life—to preserve life in the act of living.” Cartier-Bresson was connected to Surrealist circles in Paris in the 1930s, and his early photographs reinvent street life as Surrealist theater—more surprising and mysterious than the world we know. In Córdoba, Spain, he chanced upon a woman in front of a corset advertisement. In a rhyming juxtaposition, the older woman mimics the thinner, younger figure on the wall with an unconscious gesturing of her hands and a squint into the sunlight that echoes the blocked-out eyes of the painted woman: a collage of art and everyday life.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/199934/cordoba-spain

These images were copied incessantly, but some difficulty remains in identifying them, especially for a modern audience.

Softly layering multiple chalk-manner plates in colored inks, he completed the images with gold-leaf-accented frames. As the use of gold leaf was strictly regulated in France, Bonnet created an elaborate ruse: the English titles, sometimes misspelled, and printer’s address on the paper frame suggest that these prints were published in London, not Paris.

In June 1856, unprecedented floods in the Rhône Valley destroyed entire sections of Lyon, Avignon, and other towns that dated to Roman times and left tens of thousands homeless. Sent by the government to record the devastation, Baldus returned after eight days with twenty-five negatives that revealed nature’s fury in quietly dramatic images. This print is one segment of a six-part panorama, photographed on the banks of the Rhône in Avignon, which originally measured over seven feet in total length. Ernest Lacan, the well regarded editor of the photography journal La lumière, made particular note of the panorama, arguing that in an already remarkable career Baldus had only now arrived “at a perfection so complete.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/223186/avignon-flood-of-1856-avignon-inondation-de-1856

Instead he turned his attention to scenes of everyday Parisian life, often set on street corners. Artists and critics of the time praised Daumier for his skill as a draftsman, visible here in the subtle modeling and shadows used to construct an unlucky Parisian’s crumpled umbrella. Daumier further enhanced the atmospheric effects of the rainy scene by scratching lines of rain onto the printing block, rather than drawing them with a lithographic crayon.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/213791/new-patented-umbrella-with-an-improved-spring-system-to-swiftly-open-at-the-slightest-touch-please-refer-to-our-advertisement-in-the-matter-plate-33-from-emotions-parisiennes

As stylistic precursors to the French Rococo with a deep interest in theater, Gillot’s prints are satirical and revolve around ancient sculpture. The young Bacchus appears here as the devotional focal point, his head atop a herm (a stone pillar topped with a carved head or bust, sometimes with a phallus) festooned with flowers and fruit. The bas-relief hanging above shows the god discovering his future wife, Ariadne, while the text below teasingly suggests that enough wine will solve all romantic problems.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/31681/festival-of-bacchus-celebrated-by-satyrs-and-bacchantes

The first was Pablo Picasso’s illustrations for Ovid’s Metamorphoses (Les Métamorphoses), published the year before. Both series use the simple power of the etched line to suggest volume and movement. In the case of Matisse, he avoided heavy shading so as not to detract from the ethereality of Mallarmé’s poetry. While inspired by the poems, Matisse’s prints stand alone as works of art and call upon some of his most iconic imagery: flowers, nudes, and portraits.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/159025/a-few-sonnets-frontispiece-plate-24-from-poesies-de-mallarme

An elusive sense of scale and ambiguous awareness of abstraction run throughout all his images of construction sites in Paris, Dresden, and Berlin. Here he photographs Seoul, Korea, where the expanding city is encroaching on the rural countryside. The large scale of the photographs makes the “wall” of the new apartment buildings more obvious. It is also part of a style of monumental photographs that has been part of the fascination with the work of the German photographers from Dusseldorf: Andreas Gursky, Thomas Struth, and Thomas Ruff.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/157060/seoul-series-monuments

A rider protecting a child in his arms gallops past desolate plunging ravines, driven by an unseen threat. Redon’s dramatic etching may refer to the Elfking (Der Erlkönig), a tragic 1782 poem by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. In that work, a father tries to reassure his anxious, dangerously ill son that the hostile elements that beset them are not elves trying to spirit him away. Though the child dies, the poem remains open to interpretation. Indeed, Redon’s forbidding landscape strongly suggests the presence of supernatural forces only the doomed son could sense.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/106581/fear

Fra_3987,Dominique-Vivant Denon,Lithograph on off-white wove paper,Lithography Lesson,"The painter and printmaker Dominique-Vivant Denon excelled in quick sketches of people and monuments. In 1798 he accompanied a French expedition to Egypt, documenting architectural settings for many of the artifacts Napoleon acquired. Back in France, Denon produced numerous lithographs in the same lively manner and hosted gatherings in which guests attempted to produce lithographs themselves. Here the group admires the skill of one of Denon’s female guests, possibly also his pupil. Unusually, she draws a muscular naked man on her thin lithographic stone. In this period, women receiving professional academy training did not study from the nude, yet this amateur exudes pride in her accomplishment.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/41768/lithography-lesson

Arranged to evoke traditional French gardens such as the Tuileries in Paris, paperweights like this example brought a little of this landscaping magic indoors.From the late 1840s to early 1860s, French manufacturers of fine glass and crystal—such as Baccarat (Alsace), Clichy (Paris), and Saint-Louis (Lorraine)—catered to the vast public enthusiasm for beautiful yet functional desk accessories.

Framed in a similar fashion to other images by Barye of animals such as lions and tigers, this lithograph shows a black bear from the exotic state of Mississippi. These large beasts were plentiful there until around 1900, attracting big game hunters, including President Theodore Roosevelt. During his 1902 visit to the Mississippi Delta, the president refused to shoot an injured and lassoed bear, considering it unsportsmanlike. This humane response is said to have inspired a toymaker to produce the Teddy Bear. After a precipitous population decline and a recent recolonization effort, black bears in Mississippi are now making a comeback.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/22868/mississippi-bear

Fra_4336,Roger Parry,Gelatin silver print,Untitled,"Roger Parry began his photographic career in 1928 in the service of advertising and architectural design. To accompany a 1930 edition of poet Leon-Paul Fargue’s Banalité, the artist created a series of enigmatic photographic illustrations. The Banalité images work as a complement to Fargue’s Symbolist poetry, recasting a group of unrelated scenes into a cryptic sequence. Like this image of a locomotive, many of the illustrations are negative prints, cropped at dramatic angles; others include cameraless images (photograms), which Parry would have associated with the work of Man Ray. After meeting Parry in Paris, Julien Levy included the artist’s photographs in several exhibitions at his Manhattan galleries, including Surréalisme and Modern European Photography in 1932. In addition to purchasing the Banalité photographs, Levy acquired storyboards for a photographic series that Parry planned but never finalized, which indicated the artist’s intentions to continue exploring the photo-narrative as an effective art form.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/129770/untitled

The play had gained considerable popularity in France by 1844. Though little is known of the specifics of this particular commission, it was a project that captivated Théodore Chassériau for years. These two prints, from Chassériau’s series of 15 plates, illustrate the emotional crescendo of Desdemona and Othello’s relationship. Plate 9 tenderly represents Desdemona’s despair when she sings the Willow Song. Her words—“Let nobody blame him; his scorn I approve”—are prophetic. Later, convinced of her infidelity, Othello smothers her with a pillow. Plate 14 shows the moment Emilia tells Othello of Desdemona’s innocence and Iago’s treachery. Chassériau’s use of gesture links the three central characters in a dramatic pyramidal composition that conveys the poignant meaning of the scene.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/83878/oh-oh-oh-plate-fourteen-from-othello

Gautier signed Duverney’s name on his completed mezzotint plates to acknowledge the surgeon as the inventor of these anatomical compositions. Duverney likely prepared the dissected specimens with wax both to intensify their color and increase their longevity. The varnish Gautier used to turn his prints into “printed paintings” increased surface durability while also heightening the color saturation. As a result, the tone of these muscles and the relief of the veins in the Cranium study are particularly striking.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/149493/neck-muscles-plate-three-from-complete-musculature-in-natural-size-and-color

In February 1932, New York collector and gallery owner Julien Levy, who is commonly credited with introducing Surrealism to an American audience, included Lotar’s work in an influential exhibition titled “Modern European Photography.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/92185/untitled

The first was Pablo Picasso’s illustrations for Ovid’s Metamorphoses (Les Métamorphoses), published the year before. Both series use the simple power of the etched line to suggest volume and movement. In the case of Matisse, he avoided heavy shading so as not to detract from the ethereality of Mallarmé’s poetry. While inspired by the poems, Matisse’s prints stand alone as works of art and call upon some of his most iconic imagery: flowers, nudes, and portraits.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/159005/le-pitre-chatie-plate-four-from-poesies-de-mallarme
