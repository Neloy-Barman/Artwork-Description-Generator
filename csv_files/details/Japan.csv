jp_1,Katsushika Hokusai,Color woodblock print; oban,"Under the Wave off Kanagawa (Kanagawa oki nami ura), also known as The Great Wave, from the series “Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji (Fugaku sanjūrokkei)”","Katsushika Hokusai’s much celebrated series, Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji (Fugaku sanjûrokkei), was begun in 1830, when the artist was 70 years old. This tour-de-force series established the popularity of landscape prints, which continues to this day. Perhaps most striking about the series is Hokusai’s copious use of the newly affordable Berlin blue pigment, featured in many of the compositions in the color for the sky and water. Mount Fuji is the protagonist in each scene, viewed from afar or up close, during various weather conditions and seasons, and from all directions.The most famous image from the set is the “Great Wave” (Kanagawa oki nami ura), in which a diminutive Mount Fuji can be seen in the distance under the crest of a giant wave. The three impressions of Hokusai’s Great Wave in the Art Institute are all later impressions than the first state of the design.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/24645/under-the-wave-off-kanagawa-kanagawa-oki-nami-ura-also-known-as-the-great-wave-from-the-series-thirty-six-views-of-mount-fuji-fugaku-sanj%E7%AC%9Brokkei
jp_2,Tosa Mitsuoki,"Six-panel screen (one of pair); Ink, colors, gold leaf, and gold powder on silk",Autumn Maples with Poem Slips,"Japanese aristocrats engaged in the elegant custom of recollecting classical poetry while viewing spring and autumn foliage. In these delicate screens, premier court painter Tosa Mitsuoki meditated on the inevitable passage of beauty by depicting the melancholy hours after the departure of reveling courtiers. A cherry tree bursts into bloom on the right screen (seen here at top), while its mate displays the brilliant red and gold foliage of maples in autumn. Slips of poetry, called tanzaku, waft from the blossoming limbs, the lingering signs of a human presence. Courtiers (whose names are recorded in a seventeenth-century document) assisted Mitsuoki by inscribing the narrow strips with quotations of appropriate seasonal poetry from twelfth- and thirteenth-century anthologies. The screens were either commissioned by or given to Tofukumon’in (1607–1678), a daughter of the Tokugawa shogun who married the emperor Gomizunoo (1596–1680). In an era otherwise marked by increasing control of the feudal shogunate over imperial prerogatives, this royal couple encouraged a renaissance of courtly taste that nostalgically evoked the past glories of early medieval aristocratic life.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/127644/autumn-maples-with-poem-slips
jp_3,,"Wood core, dry lacquer, traces of gold leaf",Seated Bodhisattva,"This rare and important sculpture represents a Buddhist bodhisattva, or bosatsu, an enlightened and compassionate being who postponed Buddhahood in order to help save others. Calm, stately, and full-bodied, the bosatsu is seated in a frontal, meditative pose; his gracefully held hands, raised midair, make a gesture of assurance. Buddhism, which originated in India with the teachings of the Buddha Sakyamuni, or Siddhartha Gautama (c. 563-c. 483 B.C.), was named the official religion of Japan at the beginning of the eighth century by the Emperor Shomu (701-56). This small, finely crafted lacquer figure is the only Buddhist sculpture outside Japan that is firmly attributed to the influential sculpture workshop of Todai-ji, the largest and most prestigious of the great state-sponsored Buddhist temples built during the Nara period. This sculpture represents a dramatic shift in Japanese sculptural tradition—a move away from the expensive, time-consuming technique of using lacquer (a resin extracted from the sap of a tree) over a temporary clay core that, once removed, left a sculpture that was completely hollow except for perhaps a wood bracing system. Here a sculpted wood core is overlaid with lacquer-soaked cloth. The innovative sculptors at the Nara temple modeled the wet and pliable surface of the cloth to create fine details such as facial features and jewelry. Finally the sculpture was gilt; traces of gold remain on the bodhisattva’s face and chest.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/111380/seated-bodhisattva
jp_4,Kazuo Shiraga,Oil on canvas,Golden Wings Brushing the Clouds Incarnated from Earthly Wide Star (Chikatsusei Maunkinshi),"Shiraga Kazuo was one of the most widely known artists associated with the Gutai Art Association. Gutai (“concreteness” in Japanese) was formed in 1954 and swiftly became postwar Japan’s most significant avant-garde collective. In its manifesto the group advocated for an exuberant, ethically invested freedom of expression: “Gutai Art imparts life to matter.”Shiraga once described the world as a “splendid playground.” He sought an unmediated form of painting, soon abandoning the traditional brush in order to paint with his feet, swinging himself from ropes over sheets of paper placed on the floor. The earliest of these pioneering works were made as part of live performances, but from 1959 Shiraga continued his practice on canvas and within his studio. This 1960 painting demonstrates the range of simultaneously sensuous and dynamic effects the artist could achieve through his singular method — slick, muscular smears of brighter and darker reds and oranges contrast with vigorous insertions of deep blue as well as with a fringe of more atmospheric stains of color. The title refers to the celebrated fourteenth-century Chinese novel Shuihu zhuan (Water Margin), which follows the feats of outlaw Song Jiang and his band of accomplices.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/220272/golden-wings-brushing-the-clouds-incarnated-from-earthly-wide-star-chikatsusei-maunkinshi
jp_5,Suzuki Harunobu,Color woodblock print; chuban,"Evening Snow on a Floss Shaper (Nurioke no bosetsu), from the series “Eight Views of the Parlor (Zashiki hakkei)”","The famous series Eight Views of the Parlor was produced in 1766, around the time of the emergence of full-color prints in Japan. The series contains eight prints that were housed together in a fanciful wrapper, all of which are now in the Art Institute’s collection. These scenes present visual puns based on well-known themes of the Xiao and Xiang Rivers in China, each of which has its own poetic title. For Evening Snow, Suzuki Harunobu depicted silk floss as snow and the floss shaper as the mountain rather than showing snow-covered hills.Such witty visual riddles would have been appreciated by the audience of these prints—wealthy, well-educated townsmen who participated in poetry circles. One such figure was Ōkubo Jinshirō Tadanobu, whose pseudonym was Kyosen. It is thought that he produced this set, engaging Harunobu’s services as well as those of the printer. In fact, this image contains Kyosen’s handwritten signature, leading scholars to believe that the Art Institute’s set is the first edition. Sets with Harunobu’s signature exist in other collections.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/88977/evening-snow-on-a-floss-shaper-nurioke-no-bosetsu-from-the-series-eight-views-of-the-parlor-zashiki-hakkei
jp_6,Yamakawa Shûhô,Two-panel screen; ink and color on silk,Relaxing in the Shade,"Here, two beauties, or moga—short for modan gaaru, or modern girls—sit on the beach, dressed in the latest sportswear and enjoying their ample leisure time. A delicately scalloped gray shape encircles the two friends, and we soon realize that it is the shadow cast by an unseen umbrella.The woman on the right in particular stares confrontationally, as though daring us to gaze at her. She wears a sheer blouse, and her bathing suit and arms are slightly visible beneath it. She has a Western-style bob haircut and one of the newfangled permanent waves popular in the 1930s. Her friend lounges in a sleeveless jumpsuit. At the height of fashion for the beach are their stripes, seen in their clothing and accessories, and even carried into the way the artist, Yamakawa Shūhō, has rendered their hair. They are surrounded by their accessories—a broad-rimmed hat, a ukulele, and a purse shaped like a volleyball with a handle.The woman on the right has been identified as Yamamoto Chiyoko, the daughter of a prominent Tokyo family and one of Shūhō’s students. One day after class, she was to meet a friend, Ota Misuzu, for an excursion to a coastal area close to Tokyo. The artist accompanied them and made sketches for this final composition.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/156474/relaxing-in-the-shade
jp_7,Ike Taiga,Hanging scroll; ink on paper,Group Pilgrimage to the Jizo Nun,"Ike Taiga was a revolutionary known for revitalizing Japanese painting traditions in the eighteenth century. He infused the Chinese-inspired ink painting (nanga) that was gaining favor among intellectuals in Kyoto with a purely Japanese aesthetic and humor. Group Pilgrimage to the Jizo Nun is a snapshot of contemporary life in Japan presented from Taiga’s unique perspective. The print depicts pilgrims making offerings to the Jizo nun, a holy woman believed to be able to communicate with the bodhisattva Jizo, who had the power to save souls in the afterlife.Group Pilgrimage contains an inscription relating the story of the Jizo nun. Taiga was a master calligrapher, poet, and seal carver and was well versed in all forms of writing, from ancient seal script to cursive kana. Here he rendered the inscription in a cursive, informal style very much in keeping with the spontaneity of the painting itself. Taiga was also renowned for his use of finger painting and other odd techniques. Although opinions vary as to whether or not this work is a finger painting, it is clear that Taiga did not use a traditional brush. It seems likely that this could be a “paper twist painting,” in which the artist worked with scraps of twisted paper charged with ink.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/185222/group-pilgrimage-to-the-jizo-nun
jp_8,Tōshūsai Sharaku,Color woodblock print; oban,The actor Bando Mitsugoro II as Ishii Genzo,"Almost nothing is known of the life of Tōshūsai Sharaku, whose entire oeuvre of bold portraits of Kabuki actors was produced during a ten-month period in 1794–95. Sharaku’s prints are frank and piercing, combining satire with decorative power. His aggressive style is made all the more dramatic by his use of a dark mica background, which throws the silhouette of the posturing actor into strong relief. Depicted here is the actor Bandō Mitsugorō portraying the character Ishii Genzō at the peak dramatic moment of the play The Iris Sōga of the Bunroku Era (Hanaayame Bunroku Sōga). With a look of intense fury, Genzō draws his sword to aid his two brothers-in-law in avenging their father’s murder. The play is based on an event that occurred in 1701 that disrupted the civil order of the Tokugawa shogunate and scandalized the population of Edo. Commentary on contemporary issues was discouraged by the Japanese government, however, so the play was disguised as a literary recounting of a famous twelfth-century act of filial revenge that occurred in the Sōga family. Unlike the elite and highly stylized Noh theater, Kabuki was a popular form of drama that reflected and catered to the tastes and pleasures of the emerging merchant class.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/89856/the-actor-bando-mitsugoro-ii-as-ishii-genzo
jp_9,Tawaraya Sôtatsu,"Six-panel screen; ink, color, and gold on paper",Maize and Cockscombs,"During the Edo period, the prosperity and political unification of Japan under the ruling Tokugawa shoguns led to the emergence of a magnificent Japanese decorative style characterized by a love of bold patterns and bright colors. This new style was supported by the military class, a disenfranchised aristocracy, and a thriving class of merchants and entrepreneurs. The surviving half of an original pair, this splendid screen elegantly embodies both the techniques of ancient court painters and the curiosity and confidence so prevalent in the Edo period. Bursting with sensual fullness, the maize and cockscombs are rendered with the accuracy of a botanical drawing, a testimony to the era’s interest in natural science. The appearance of maize, a grain not native to Japan, indicates a willingness to assimilate new subject matter on the part of Edo artists and patrons.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/11272/maize-and-cockscombs
jp_10,,"Handscroll; ink, colors, and gold on paper",Legends of the Yūzū Nembutsu Sect,"This handscroll illustrates the foundation of the Yūzū Nembutsu sect of Japanese Buddhism. A priest named Ryōnin (1072–1132) founded the sect in the Heian period (794–1185). He taught that individuals could attain rebirth in the Western paradise of Amida Buddha, the primary buddha of the Pure Land branch of Buddhism, merely by chanting his name. “Yuzu Nembutsu” means “chanting [Amida’s] name in communion”—a reference to the belief that chanting by one person would affect all other beings.This scene is the culmination of the scroll and shows different faiths coming together in support of Ryōnin.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/56731/legends-of-the-y%E7%AC%9Bz%E7%AC%9B-nembutsu-sect
jp_11,,"Silk, 4:1 satin damask weave (rinzu); embroidered with silk and gold-leaf-over-lacquered-paper-strip-wrapped silk in satin stitches; laid work and couching, and padded couching; lined with silk, plain weave",Furisode,"This furisode, a long-sleeved garment worn by children and unmarried women on special occasions, belonged to a family whose crest was the tachibana, the flower of the Mandarin orange. Made of rinzu (a soft, lustrous silk), it probably was used as an uchikake (outer coat). The red fabric is woven in a pattern that combines geometric and floral forms. A blossoming plum tree embroidered with gold and white silk thread spreads its branches from hem to shoulder. The carefully embroidered blooming tree shows the influence of Western art on Japanese design. Needlework typical of this period was used to portray illusionistically the contours of the tree trunk. First the edges of the trunk were padded with a heavy thread; then, over this padding, gold-wrapped thread was couched with red silk thread.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/150739/furisode
jp_12,,Glazed stoneware,Oribe-Type Ewer,"Furuta Oribe (1544–1615) was a military general–turned–tea aesthete whose style of presentation at tea gatherings catered to the samurai class and rulers of seventeenth-century Japan. In contrast to his predecessors, Oribe preferred tea wares that were bold and eccentric rather than subtle and rustic. He was the first to recognize the beauty of artfully misshapen ceramics for use in tea gatherings. Ewers such as this were employed as water containers during the meal that preceded the tea service. Their distinctive glaze contains copper, which turned green in the firing process. This glaze, along with slightly off-kilter or distorted shapes, became trademarks of Oribe ware produced in the Mino region (now Gifu Prefecture) of Japan.This vessel features drawings of plum blossoms, wheels, a hexagonal tortoiseshell pattern, and a lattice, all done in an underglaze iron wash. This is typical of such wares, which most often do not have a single decorative theme, but rather depict a mélange of almost abstract motifs akin to the popular patterning on textiles of the period.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/9512/oribe-type-ewer

Hokusai’s most famous work is the series Fugaku sanju-rokkei (Thirty-Six Views of Mount Fuji), created between 1830 and 1832, when the artist was over seventy years of age. This brilliant series actually consists of forty-six views of the well-known mountain: the extra ten scenes were added by Hokusai to the initial thirty-six views. The ingenuity of artistic expression and the astonishing variety of vantage points from which Mount Fuji is viewed are a testament to Hokusai’s creativity.
Mount Fuji, known as “Fuji-san,” is the highest mountain in Japan, with a height of 12,385 feet. Once an active volcano, its last great eruption was in 1707. Well before Hokusai’s time, Mount Fuji had been worshipped as a sacred mountain, and in his day it was a destination for pilgrims from all over Japan.While known for his novel and dynamic compositions, Hokusai’s greatest strength was undoubtedly his remarkable draftsmanship. As a colorist, he was capable of being both bold and sensitive, and much of his success depended on his judicious combination of both exceptional drawing and dazzling color. Here, the mountain is shown with clear skies at its summit and a thunderstorm near its base. The combination of the elegant sloping sides of the volcano and the sharp, jagged lines of lightning at the bottom results in an image of great simplicity and visual force.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/87008/shower-below-the-summit-sanka-hakuu-from-the-series-thirty-six-views-of-mount-fuji-fugaku-sanjurokkei

After his death, Kûkai received the name Kôbô Daishi (Great Teacher of the Divine Law) and was revered as a saint.The inscription at the top of this painting is a quotation from the Goyuigo, a set of instructions believed to have been prepared by Kukai for his disciples. In the passage, Kukai describes a dream he had as a child in which he was carried aloft on an eight-petaled lotus flower to a heavenly realm where he conversed with various Buddhas.

Perhaps most striking about the series is Hokusai’s copious use of the newly affordable Berlin blue pigment, featured in many of the compositions in the color for the sky and water. Mount Fuji is the protagonist in each scene, viewed from afar or up close, during various weather conditions and seasons, and from all directions.The most famous image from the set is the “Great Wave” (Kanagawa oki nami ura), in which a diminutive Mount Fuji can be seen in the distance under the crest of a giant wave.

The tale was popular in the 18th century, eventually inspiring a novel and several Kabuki plays. Here, the skeletal ghost of Kohada Koheiji pulls down the mosquito net and eerily peers at the sleeping couple in their bed.The Art Institute’s collection boasts one of the most well-preserved and appreciated editions of Katsushika Hok usa i’s One Hundred Ghost Tales series (1831–32). The artist apparently planned to produce a full hundred images, but the series was not completed and only five prints are known. The title refers to a game in which people would gather at night to tell scary stories, putting out a candle after each tale until the room was completely dark. These small-format works feature a bright-blue color made possible by Berlin blue pigment (often called “Prussian blue”), which had become affordable shortly before their production. Although this hue may seem cheery to us, Hokusai’s original audience would have associated it with death and the occult.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/47398/kohada-koheiji-from-the-series-one-hundred-ghost-tales-hyaku-monogatari

These visions would continue to influence her art and appear in her performances, paintings, sculptures, and environments throughout her career. In 1957 Kusama moved from Japan to New York and began her “infinity net” paintings, filling canvases with minimal, meditative compositions of netlike patterns. While these patterns appear to be devoid of an overtly expressive quality, the artist’s labor-intensive technique of mark making reflects her highly emotive intent and obsessive concern with process.

His Landscape of the Four Seasons is the only work in the exhibition from the 16th century. Sesson’s dreamlike Chinese landscape expands before our eyes in understandable spatial depth, an effect that is enhanced by the folds of the screen. We read the composition like the Japanese language, from right to left, and follow the flow of the seasons from the first red plum blossoms of the year, all the way across to the snow-covered mountains on the far left. A mountain temple on the right and a village on the left enclose an inlet upon which boats come and go. People bustle about in activity, geologically impossible rock formations twist and turn, and water splashes out from the bottom of a waterfall like reaching fingers.For adherents of Zen Buddhism, a sect with origins in China, idealized landscapes described a world akin to paradise, in which intellectual and religious activities could be pursued unhindered and the cycle of the seasons spoke of the harmony and rebirth inherent in the natural world.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/7634/landscape-of-the-four-seasons

The carving hints at the deity’s strong body beneath his armor, which still bears the traces of elaborate decoration: patterns of dragons and flowers in gold and bright colors.This figure represents Bishamon, the chief of the four guardian devas (or shitennō) who protect the four cardinal directions in a Buddhist sanctuary.

jp_190,Inagaki Tomoo,Color woodblock print,Cat Making Up,"This sketch and final print illustrate the artist’s working method. First, Inagaki Tomoo made a sketch in pencil that he later drew over in ink. He then laid the sketch face down on a wet block and rubbed it from the back to transfer the ink to the block, which he used as a guide for carving. Some of the ink outlines in the sketch have transferred onto the finished print, while other lines have been carved into the wood and therefore carry no color on the paper, as is the case with the contour of the cat’s leg.
Inagaki’s affection for geometric forms is apparent in this print, which has the quality of a stained-glass window. The print collector Oliver Statler, who knew the artist well, has written that there is only one cat in the print—the two heads represent the movement of the bathing cat.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16227/cat-making-up

Here the artist used an extremely large brush, working quickly across the black surface. Morita’s vigorous style often results in nearly abstract forms that no longer appear to be words. In this work, the character for dragon becomes more expressive of the actual animal with a long, sinewy tail flying through the air.The notion of abstraction had been part of the practice of East Asian calligraphy for many centuries, and Morita wrote often about the interplay between traditional Japanese calligraphy and abstract art in the West. He collaborated with European artists of the Abstract Expressionist movement such as Pierre Alechinsky and Georges Mathieu, and American artists Mark Tobey and Franz Kline influenced and were influenced by contemporary Japanese calligraphy such as Morita’s works.Though the work may appear to be executed with lacquer, in actuality the metallic paint—which is silver in tone—was brushed onto black paper and then covered with a coat of yellow varnish.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/62558/dragon-knows-dragon-ryu-wa-ryu-wo-shiru

The screen on the right features the stalks of bamboo rising from the ground by a stream, while on the left we imagine the lofty upper reaches of the leaves beyond the top edge of the work.
Ganku rendered the sectional trunks of bamboo by loading the brush with ink and moving it evenly across the surface of the painting. In areas where the ink skipped across the non-absorbent gold or was mixed with animal glue, the results are naturalistic effects mimicking the bamboo’s texture or the play of light on its surface.The severe cropping of the plants enhances the effect that one has, when standing or sitting close to the screens, of being in the midst of a bamboo grove. This was completely intentional. Evidence suggests that these screens were part of a set of five pairs originally meant to be set up around the perimeter of a room or rooms during a salonlike gathering of would-be literati who compared themselves to the legendary Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/198910/bamboo

A mountain temple on the right and a village on the left enclose an inlet upon which boats come and go. People bustle about in activity, geologically impossible rock formations twist and turn, and water splashes out from the bottom of a waterfall like reaching fingers.For adherents of Zen Buddhism, a sect with origins in China, idealized landscapes described a world akin to paradise, in which intellectual and religious activities could be pursued unhindered and the cycle of the seasons symbolized the harmony and rebirth inherent in the natural world.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/7633/landscape-of-the-four-seasons

The title refers to a game in which people would gather at night to tell scary stories, putting out a candle after each tale until the room was completely dark.

jp_335,,"Pair of six-panel screens; ink, colors, and gold on paper",The Tale of Taishokan,"This screen narrates the medieval Taishokan tale, an action-adventure story that captivated medieval and early modern audiences whether they saw it performed on the Noh, Bunraku or Kabuki stage, or depicted in paintings and prints. The many variants of the tale combine elements from early Japanese mythology and history; 14th-century Buddhist temple origin legend (engi) that reflects continuing anxiety about foreign invasion in the wake of the Mongol attacks of the late 13th century, and Noh play motifs.
The story unfolds from right to left, opening with a scene in and around the courtyard of Fujiwara Kamatari’s residence in the Nara area. Kamatari, the most powerful courtier of the seventh century, was the first and only person ever granted the rank of ‘Taishokan,’ the highest rank in a system used only between 647 and 685. According to legend, reputation of Kamatari daughter’s beauty made its way to China, where the emperor Taizong fell in love with her sight unseen, and asked to marry her. Kamatari’s daughter, Kohakunyo, is shown boarding her carriage to be sent abroad on the ships depicted below. Her new home, the Chinese court, is shown to the left. On the left screen, the treasures that the princess sends back to Japan, the most precious of them a jewel in which is embedded a tiny statue of the Buddha, have been entrusted to the Chinese general Wanhu. Wanhu is shown in battle with the forces of the dragon king who lives beneath the sea and succeeds in stealing the precious jewel. In the end, Kamatari (in other versions, such as the Noh play Ama [15th c.] and Chikamatsu Monzaemon’s Bunraku play Taishokan [1711], it is Kamatari’s grandson Fusasaki) enlists the help of a diver woman to recover the stolen jewel. She manages to sneak into the undersea Dragon Palace, recover the jewel, and escape—pursued by the Dragon King’s horde. Just as she reaches the surface—at the very center of the screen—she is slain by one of the Dragon King’s minions, a serpent-warrior. When the men on Kamatari’s ship recover her body, they find the jewel concealed in a slit she had cut into her chest—she had knowingly sacrificed herself, that is, to recover the precious jewel.
For a translation of one version of the Taishokan story, see Melanie Trede, Image, Text and Audience: The Taishokan Narrative in Visual Representations of the Early Modern Period (Peter Lang, 2003).",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/145673/the-tale-of-taishokan

At the left edge of the same screen, “Night Rain on the Xiao and Xiang” is given expression as streaks of ink wash through which a lone boat makes its way across the river. The artist’s combination of lively ink brushwork with golden clouds fuses both Chinese and Japanese sensibilities.A native of Kyoto, Yamaguchi Sekkei studied Chinese paintings as an apprentice in a Kano-school studio and continued to do so in earnest after becoming independent.

The location pictured is Uji, an area of great spiritual significance and a link between the ancient cities of Nara and Kyoto. By the Edo period (1615–1868), certain elements were sufficient to evoke the famous site: the curved bridge, willows, moon, waterwheel, trailing mist, and rock-filled baskets are all elements taken from classical poetry.
The artist Hasegawa Soya was the son of Hasegawa Tohaku (1539–1610), an innovator in producing dynamic large-format works. An impressive amount of precious materials went into the fabrication of this pair. Gold and silver were used in leaf form on the bridge and moon, as cut squares and dust in the clouds, and as paint for the lines of the current. Gold paint has also been used over oyster-shell-white pigment (gofun) to create a raised effect in the baskets and the waterwheel. In addition, the application of the gold leaf diagonally to accentuate the curve of the bridge is a rare feature.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/160015/willow-bridge-and-waterwheel

Though they take place at disparate times in the story, the five episodes selected from the novel’s fifty-four chapters are set in one continuous landscape. Among these scenes is one on the far right showing the baby Genji being presented to his father, the emperor, for the first time. Across the bottom of left screen, court ladies argue which season is the most beautiful. Above, in the upper right corner, Genji and his love, Lady Murasaki, share an intimate moment in front of a charcoal brazier.Each scene was seemingly chosen for its felicitous overtones. The overall character of the pair suggest that they were painted to be part of a bride’s wedding trousseau, and would therefore accompany her to her new home. Lavishly decorated folding screens made up an important part of such collections, which included kimono, lacquer toiletry sets, games, and other luxury items.The figural style and landscape are reminiscent of the Kano school of painters.

Here he selected a basalt with an exterior of fossilized mud in tones of yellow, brown, and gold and a blackish-gray interior. He cleaved all three parts of the sculpture from one large stone, which is evident in the way their contours fit together. Though the finished product may still appear to be raw, Izumi amplified the natural character of the stone by meticulously cutting or polishing every surface. Islands is thus a contemporary work that recalls a Japanese tradition of reverence for natural materials.Generations of the Izumi family were stonemasons in the town of Mure on the island of Shikoku. Izumi Masatoshi began to focus on stonecutting as an artistic medium at an early age. In 1964 he began a decades-long collaboration with Isamu Noguchi, whose stone sculptures he executed until Noguchi’s death in 1988.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/206379/islands-shimatachi

The artist apparently planned to produce a full hundred images, but the series was not completed and only five prints are known. The title refers to a game in which people would gather at night to tell scary stories, putting out a candle after each tale until the room was completely dark. These small-format works feature a bright-blue color made possible by Berlin blue pigment (often called “Prussian blue”), which had become affordable shortly before their production.

Fuji (Suso ichimonji), No. 14 from the series “Munakata’s Tokaido (Tokaido Munakata hanga)”","This and the other 61 prints in the series were the result of seven sketching trips along the Tôkaidô Road that Munakata Shikô undertook between April 1963 and February 1964. The Tôkaidô Road connected Tokyo (then Edo) to Kyoto in the premodern period, and its scenery and post towns were immortalized by print artists such as Utagawa Hiroshige. Taking the idea of Hiroshige’s famous series Fifty-Three Stations of the Tôkaidô Road as his basis, Munakata set out to capture the humanity of encounters along the road from a modern perspective. Hara: A Line at the Foot of Mount Fuji is the artist’s emotional response to the wonderment and magnitude of Japan’s highest peak.Artist Biography:
Munakata Shikô (1903-75) was one of the most distinguished Japanese printmakers of the twentieth century, renowned for combining bold imagery with traditional subject matter. Born in the remote northern province of Aomori, Munakata moved to Tokyo and became a member of the Creative Print (Sôsaku Hanga) movement. In contrast to the collaborative process of traditional ukiyo-e, Creative Print artists designed, carved, and printed their own woodblocks. Within this movement, Munakata developed his own exhuberant style of printmaking. Extremely nearsighted, he kept his face almost at the surface of the woodblock when carving, and could rarely view his art in its entirety. Yet he worked with an intutive spontaneity, wielding his carving tools with great speed.Munakata frequently drew his inspiration from traditional sources, such as Japanese mythology, theater, and literature. As he became involved with the twentieth-century Japanese Folk Art (Mingei) movement, Munakata also began to expore Buddhist imagery. He frequently included the word “stake” (saku, an offering of Buddhist pilgrims) in his titles, thus associationg his printmaking with a Buddhist devotional act. As Munakata wrote, “At every stage in my career I like to leave behind a print or picture as if I were offering a prayer.” Munakata’s approach and subject matter distinguish him from his Creative Print contemporaries, who favored figural studies and landscapes.Munakata’s mastery of the woodblock medium was internationally recognized. He garnered top honors at several print biennials in the 1950s and received the highest artistic accolades in his own country.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/23474/hara-a-line-at-the-foot-of-mt-fuji-suso-ichimonji-no-14-from-the-series-munakata-s-tokaido-tokaido-munakata-hanga

He did his post-graduate work at the Kyoto City University of Arts. He was a professor at Seian College of Art and Design from 1973-2003. He became a professor at Osaka Seikei Univeristy in 2003. Kubota exhibited his work extensively in Tokyo and Kyoto during the early 1970s, as well as in Switzerland, where he consistently partook in the Lausanne Biennial until it came to an end in 1995. He has also been included in 50 international group exhibitions in the United States, Australia, Poland, and Mexico.Kubota’s use of color, technique, and material, with which he creates shapes and forms that occupy space in a very personal way, defines his art. He described his work as “the echo of opposites, the harmony of contrast. Humorous and profound, comical with desolate, desolate with beautiful, moving through space and time.”Kubota was greatly influenced by American fiber art during his early career, specifically by artists like Ed Rossbach, Lenore Tawney, Claire Zeisler, and Sheila Hicks—all of whom are part of the Art Institute’s textile collection. In the piece Color Intersection M-ll, which he designed and executed in 1997, the artist introduced a piece dominated by gradations of color that were weft-resist dyed in a very simple composition of folded and twisted bands in plain weave. These bands were subsequently attached to a solid plane made from a sheet of heavy Plexiglas. The 32 elements in this horizontal composition are reminiscent of an accordion. Kubota’s art tends to be three-dimensional but hung on a two-dimensional plane—the wall.Today the artist’s work appears in the following public collections: Museum Bellerieve, Zurich, Switzerland; The Art Gallery of Western Australia, Perth; and The Cleveland Museum of Art; as well as a number of prominent private collections in Kyoto.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/150159/color-intersection-m-ii

Although the country’s population was made up of hunters and gatherers during the Jomon period (12,500–300 B.C.), there was a stable pattern of settlements, making pottery production a possibility. The Jomon (literally “cord-mark decoration”) period is characterized by low-fired earthenware pottery with indentation marks, raised patterns, and sometimes flamboyant sculptural elements on the rims; such vessels can be found in regions across the Japanese archipelago. Those works displaying a highly refined artistic sense may have served ceremonial functions.This open-work decorated jar is of the Ubayama (Kasori E) type found in the Neolithic shell mounds of Ichikawa in Chiba; this vessel type is characterized by integration of ornamentation and form, and an increasingly complex manner of patterning clay.

He is perhaps best known for developing modular papertube constructions used to swiftly and inexpensively erect temporary buildings that provide shelter and services to people who have been displaced by natural disasters. Ban has also applied his practice of modular design with recyclable materials to the design of consumer objects, as seen here in the 10-Unit System, manufactured by Artek. Similar to the paper tube constructions, Ban developed a system of parts—identical in form—that can be arranged in multiple configurations. In this piece a range of objects, including a chair, a table, and a bench, can be created through the simple L-shaped component made from a wood plastic composite. Through the use of hybrid construction methods and his intimate knowledge of materials, Ban created this furniture that is easy to assemble and disassemble, providing maximum flexibility for the user.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/202122/10-unit-system-chair

Attired as if in a formal courtly setting, the women wear the many-layered kimono of the aristocracy of the Heian period (794-1185), while the men sport clothing and lacquered hats of various court ranks. Above each poet is a waka verse that he or she composed, brushed in masterful calligraphy of a general style contemporary with the poet’s lifetime. The relatively large number of female poets depicted may indicate that the screens were commissioned for use in women’s quarters.Tamechika was perhaps the most earnest of the fukko yamato-e artists who revived classical Japanese painting. Learning this technique required painstaking copying of original, centuries-old works. To this, Tamechika added an extraordinary, self-taught knowledge of court life, ceremonies, and dress. Just two months before this painting was done, Tamechika attained his long-held desire of receiving a court rank himself.
On the brink of Japan’s imperial restoration, Tamechika was seen visiting the home of a top shogunal official where he was studying works of art, and ironically, was later tracked down and assassinated, at the age of 42, by proimperialists.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/76645/twelve-poetic-immortals-and-their-poems

Several burial mounds or tumuli for chieftains and emperors still exist today, particularly around the Nara area, and it is from such locations that haniwa figurines have been excavated. In the early Kofun period, haniwa were tubular in form so that they could be easily filled with earth and buried. In the fifth century, haniwa were made in a multitude of representational forms, including male and female figures, animals, and houses.Although there are losses, most notably above the ears and at the back of the head, this sculpture has no repairs or restoration. The calm expression and symmetrical facial features make it one of the most dignified extant haniwa heads.

This new type of decorative composition coincided with an explosion of interest in botany among the shogun and regional warlords that reached all levels of society in the Edo period (1615–1868).The right screen features thick-stemmed hollyhocks, roses, chrysanthemums, bushclover, pampas grass, ﬁeld horsetail shoots, dandelions, and diminutive violets.

The frontispiece of the sutra shows the Buddha preaching at Vulture Peak. At the beginning of the text is the seal of Jingoji temple in red. The ruled lines of text are in silver, and the Chinese characters are brushed in gold in a balanced and orderly script.

Some of the ink outlines in the sketch have transferred onto the finished print, while other lines have been carved into the wood and therefore carry no color on the paper, as is the case with the contour of the cat’s leg.
Inagaki’s affection for geometric forms is apparent in this print, which has the quality of a stained-glass window.

Sesson’s dream-like Chinese landscape expands before our eyes in understandable spatial depth, an effect that is enhanced by the folds of the screen. Reading the composition in the same manner as the Japanese language, from right to left, the seasons flow from the first red plum blossoms of the year, depicted on the right side of the right screen (top), all the way across to the snow-covered mountains on the far left side of the left screen (bottom). A mountain temple on the right and a village on the left enclose an inlet upon which boats come and go. People bustle about in activity, geologically impossible rock formations twist and turn, and water splashes out from the bottom of a waterfall like reaching fingers.For adherents of Zen Buddhism, a sect with origins in China, idealized landscapes described a world akin to paradise, in which intellectual and religious activities could be pursued unhindered and the cycle of the seasons symbolized the harmony and rebirth inherent in the natural world.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/198948/landscape-of-the-four-seasons

In the story Oume, a woman who wants to steal Oiwa’s husband, sends her a topical poison disguised as a face cream. The poison immediately scars Oiwa, and her eye begins to droop, as seen in the center of the image here. When she realizes the deception, Oiwa becomes hysterical and accidentally kills herself. After her death, she seeks revenge on not just Oume but also her husband and others. The inscription on the lantern begs us to pray for her soul.The Art Institute’s collection boasts one of the most well-preserved and appreciated editions of Katsushika Hok usa i’s One Hundred Ghost Tales series (1831–32). The artist apparently planned to produce a full hundred images, but the series was not completed and only five prints are known. The title refers to a game in which people would gather at night to tell scary stories, putting out a candle after each tale until the room was completely dark. These small-format works feature a bright-blue color made possible by Berlin blue pigment (often called “Prussian blue”), which had become affordable shortly before their production. Although this hue may seem cheery to us, Hokusai’s original audience would have associated it with death and the occult.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/47403/oiwa-oiwa-san-from-the-series-one-hundred-ghost-tales-hyaku-monogatari

He was the proprietor of a pharmacy in Edo, and he was a poet, author, artist, and patron in premier cultural circles. It seems that Hyakki may have been an important influence on Suzuki Harunobu, the artist of most of the prints on display in this exhibition.

Its creation was sparked when Itô Shinsui happened upon a minstrel outside a teahouse in Ueno and was so struck by the piercing light emanating from the building that he rapidly sketched the nighttime scene. Watanabe not only had prints made from the sketch but also included a note describing their origin and production when he distributed copies to the Edo-e Kanshôkai (a club for print collectors).The note that accompanied the print reads in part:What struck Shinsui was the edge of Shinobazu Pond at night, seen through the cherry trees and old willow trees, with the contrast between the candlelight in the windows and the deep blue of the sky… . In order to transfer the freshness of the experience as faithfully as possible, I asked Shinsui to freely direct and oversee the work of the carver and printer.

jp_1197,Koji Enokura,Chromogenic print,(Oil on paper) Installation,"Koji Enokura was one of the leading practitioners of Mono-ha, the Japanese art movement that began in Tokyo in 1968 and continued into the early 1970s. Roughly translated, Mono-ha means “school of things” and references the materials, both natural and man-made, used by the artists affiliated with the movement. These “things” included dirt, glass, grease, oil, paper, plastic, rope, stone, and steel. Defining Mono-ha by materials alone denies a crucial aspect of the movement: the arrangement and placement of objects in space, and the object’s relationship to the viewer as well. As Enokura stated, “making the viewer become aware of his position in relation to the work is also something which the Mono-ha artists aimed for.”Connections can certainly be made between Mono-ha and its western counterparts of Conceptualism, Minimalism, Process Art and Earthworks. Mono-ha artists influenced by Eastern philosophies, aimed for more subtle effect than many of their Western counterparts. Indeed, much of their work relied on temporal—often ephemeral—propositions. Unlike many of the artworks of the west, they were not intended to last a lifetime. As such, photographic documentation became extremely important to Mono-ha artists. For Enokura it was crucial. He had no desire to recreate his original installations, and as time went on, the photographic document invariably (by default) became the work of art.(Oil on paper) Installation, 1974 is a photograph that documents similar installations. In this work Enokura has used paper soaked in oil. The resulting surfaces are suffused with texture. Again Enokura has arranged these materials so they can be read as either advancing or receding into space, setting up a tension between matter and environment, and viewer and object. By nature, Koji Enorkura’s work was temporary and ephemeral. It is not surprising then that he used the camera as an extension of his artistic practice. His thorough investigations, recordings and documentations of his work have allowed them to live on after they, and the artist himself, have ceased to exist.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/216909/oil-on-paper-installation

This image references the legend of Kishimojin, a goddess from early Buddhism known in Sanskrit as Hariti. Originally, this goddess was a terri-fying ogress who was determined to eat all of the babies in the town of Rajgir, India. The Buddha heard the pleas of the townspeople and hid one of Hariti’s own children, leading her to understand the grief she had caused. She then converted to Buddhism and was eventually accepted as a goddess and a protector of children.The Art Institute’s collection boasts one of the most well-preserved and appreciated editions of Katsushika Hok usa i’s One Hundred Ghost Tales series (1831–32). The artist apparently planned to produce a full hundred images, but the series was not completed and only five prints are known. The title refers to a game in which people would gather at night to tell scary stories, putting out a candle after each tale until the room was completely dark. These small-format works feature a bright-blue color made possible by Berlin blue pigment (often called “Prussian blue”), which had become affordable shortly before their production. Although this hue may seem cheery to us, Hokusai’s original audience would have associated it with death and the occult.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/47411/the-laughing-demoness-warai-hannya-from-the-series-one-hundred-ghost-tales-hyaku-monogatari

Smaller surimono usually displayed poetry made by a small group of poets that lived in the same location and belonged to the same group. They also carried a strong seasonal component and were typically created for a specific time of year, such as the New Year, or a significant date for the group, such as a retirement, birthday, or important visitor from afar.The larger prints retained this seasonal component but took on stronger commemorative roles by including bigger groups of people, sometimes unrelated to the poetry club.

Viewing painting as an experimental exercise, Arakawa believed that a canvas is a place “to trap questions, areas, operations, [and] answers” and “make them visible by combining two or more languages.” Untitled No. 2 is an example of his early paintings, which are characterized by diagrammatic floor plans and geometric grids with arrows, dotted lines, paint drips, collaged elements, and stenciled letters. The work’s pictorial plane is fractured, as standard spatial signifiers describing the rooms of a house are complicated with personal terms such as “mother” and a tear in the canvas that reveals the underlying structure.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/73049/untitled-no-2

From time to time, the government employed sumptuary laws—laws preventing extravagance—to ban the use of mica because it made prints too expensive.Even when it was legal to do so, artists likely produced mica backgrounds in limited numbers.

The recipients of her letters were instructed to turn on all their lights, wear their typical clothes, and remain still; or, if they were unwilling to take part, to lower their blinds or draw their curtains. In this way, all those addressed knew that their apartments were being watched, and that they were interacting with a stalker of sorts. The appointed time always came in the evening, so that the subjects could discern the photographer only as a silhouette.

These prints became an extension of the memorial service, a way for distant people to honor the deceased in words; here 202 people wrote commemorative poems. Such prints were also given to the participants at the memorial service.The host of the print (and probably also the memorial service) was Sasaki Ippu, a son of the departed Chikuju.

Working from aerial photographs of the highway and videotapes of the surrounding environs, he assembled a scale model from cardboard and foam and enlisted Chinese craftsmen to execute the marble relief. The material ironically highlights the motorway’s status as a defining feature of Los Angeles culture.

The 175 inscriptions were made by cultural figures and others who may have been Kikakudo’s students. The print functions as a tribute to the original Kikaku by illustrating and describing an ink stone he owned. It also acts to legitimate Kikakudo, placing him in the context of his forefather and in central positions in the composition.

Here the two artists created a New Year design; Hodai created a kite and a branch of plum blossoms, and Yoshitaki made the Kabuki actor’s portrait. Both the plum blossoms and the kite indicate the New Year. In addition, the portrait refers to the kaomise, the first appearance of Kabuki actors in the new season. The collaboration on this print between the Kabuki actor, haikai poets, and print makers suggests the cordial ties of the Osaka cultural salons, as does Yoshitaki’s signature, which commences with the word oju, or “in compliance with a request.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/42589/actor-on-kite

He increased the last act by illustrating six scenes, enhancing the dramatic impact of the end of the story. The publisher added a frame to each image, showing a repeat of Kuranosuke’s tomo-e (family crest): double commas within a circle. This was to honor the leader of the forty-seven ronin both in history and in the play. The frames also enhance the theatrical nature of each scene and make the viewer become the audience for scenes from the play.

Sugimoto began photographing bodies of water with a large-format camera in 1980, resulting in the Seascapes series, which continues to this day. Although his fascination with the subject has spanned decades, his aim remains to “capture the sea as if it were being seen for the first time.” For each body of water he visits, he makes multiple images reflecting varying times of day, shutter speeds, lengths of exposure, and atmospheric conditions. The spareness of this nocturnal image—with a barely visible horizon line bisecting sea and sky—suggests something at once elemental and eternal. Air and water are vital to life, and the world’s lakes, rivers, and oceans have been essential to the development of trade and other far-reaching human activities. Yet the body of water in this photograph seems untouched by civilization or the vicissitudes of individual lives.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/145296/lake-superior-cascade-river

Tiny white dots of shell-white pigment (gofun) form a patterned surface across the full heads of grain. Viewers who sat on tatami mats surrounded by these screens would have felt as if the billowing mass of each field was like a comfortable blanket that they could pull over themselves at night.The pairing of the sun and the moon on screens dates back several centuries and carries Buddhist, Daoist, and Shinto associations. But its combination with edible grains, as seen here, is a 16th-century innovation that is perhaps the result of improved farming technologies and seed strains that caused agricultural yields to increase.Rotation 2: August 15-September 27, 2009",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/75068/millet-fields-under-sun-and-moon

Japanese tradition holds that on New Year’s Eve, foxes gather at a specific tree near the Oji Inari Shrine in preparation for a visit to the site. On the way there, the foxes produce distinctive flames from their mouths that the local farmers can use to predict the crops of the coming year. The artist incorporated many different shades of gray to set off the barely visible fires coming from some 60 foxes approaching the shrine. Their flickering light is echoed by stars visible through the bare branches of the Changing Tree, which survives to this day.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/26617/new-year-s-eve-fox-fires-at-the-changing-tree-%C5%8Dji-shozoku-enoki-omisoka-no-kitsunebi-from-the-series-one-hundred-famous-views-of-edo-meisho-edo-hyakkei

Many examples of large-scale surimono by Shibata Zeshin exist; he must have set up a large establishment in order to cater to orders from poets and intellectuals.

This photograph was taken in Nagoya in the aftermath of the 1959 Ise Bay typhoon, one of the most devastating in Japanese history. It does not directly address the 5,000 casualties or the families left homeless by the disaster; instead, it depicts a boot, a traditional sandal, and a modern ladies’ pump rising up from the black sludge, suggesting the Japanese islands or a population adrift.

A sketch similar to the drawing might have been pasted onto the woodblock and then carved through.

Because of its tensile strength, porcelain clay was used by traditional East Asian potters to create intricate and refined shapes with thin walls. Here, however, the material takes on a rugged appearance that required many years of experimentation to achieve. After shaping, a transparent blue glaze was poured over the clay. It collected into droplets of glass at the bottom of the exterior sides as well as within the smoother interior, where it evokes a shallow pool of water and contrasts with the sharp outer edges.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/187130/square-bowl
