nl_1,Piet Mondrian,Oil on canvas,"Lozenge Composition with Yellow, Black, Blue, Red, and Gray","Piet Mondrian, a painter of the revolutionary international movement De Stijl (the Style), argued that “the straight line tells the truth.” Why, then, we might wonder, would he choose to hang a painting off axis, where its edges imply dynamic diagonals? Among other motivations, rotating the canvas allowed Mondrian to reconsider a question he spent his career exploring, namely, the relationship between the contents of a painting and what contains them. In Lozenge Composition, the squared-off black lines imply enclosure, while a single line (above the blue area) extends to the slanted edge, suggesting extension beyond the canvas. This implication of what might lie beyond also prompted Mondrian to invoke the full expanse of the wall by hanging diagonal paintings well above eye level.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/109819/lozenge-composition-with-yellow-black-blue-red-and-gray
nl_2,Jan Sanders van Hemessen,Oil on panel,Judith,"Judith was considered one of the most heroic women of the Old Testament. According to the biblical story, when her city was besieged by the Assyrian army, the beautiful young widow gained access to the quarters of the general Holofernes. After winning his confidence and getting him drunk, she took his sword and cut off his head, thereby saving the Jewish people. Although Judith was often shown richly and exotically clothed, Jan Sanders van Hemessen chose to present her as a monumental nude, aggressively brandishing her sword even after severing Holofernes’s head.Van Hemessen was one of the chief proponents of a style, popular in the Netherlands in the first half of the sixteenth century, that was deeply indebted to the monumental character of classical sculpture, as well as to the art of Michelangelo Buonarroti and Raphael. Judith’s muscular body and her elaborate, twisting pose reflect these influences. Yet the use of the aggressive nude figure here also suggests a certain ambivalence on the part of the artist and his audience toward the seductive wiles Judith may have employed to disarm Holofernes. In this work, Van Hemessen combined an idealized form with precisely rendered textures, as in the hair and beard of Holofernes and Judith’s gauzy headdress and brocaded bag. The interplay between the straining pose of the figure, the dramatic lighting, and the fastidiously recorded surfaces serves to heighten the tension of this composition.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/4575/judith

Wtewael,Oil on copper,The Battle between the Gods and the Giants,"The subject of the victory of the gods of Olympus over the ancient race of giants provided Joachim Wtewael with the opportunity to depict exaggerated athletic poses and striking contrasts of space and light. From the clouds, the Olympian gods wield their attributes as weapons: Jupiter hurls thunderbolts; Neptune brandishes his triton; and Mercury uses his caduceus as a spear. The helmeted figure on the right is Minerva, the goddess of wisdom and war. The painting’s gemlike effect results from the use of a copper support and from its small scale. The artist’s self-conscious display of his skills was a hallmark of the international style known as Mannerism, which was fashionable in Holland around 1600.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/105466/the-battle-between-the-gods-and-the-giants

The beautifully bare princess Andromeda has been chained to a bone-strewn rock as food for a ravening sea beast, when Perseus swoops in on Pegasus to do battle with the creature and save the damsel in distress. Andromeda’s nudity is accentuated by her flowing locks, blown dramatically by the wind and waves; she is a comely tidbit for monster or man. Saenredam’s early training was in cartography, and his rendition of Goltzius’s sea beast resembles the hybrid stock characters that populate dangerous uncharted waters of 16th-century maps.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/40/andromeda

He was particularly inspired by the flat topography of his native Holland, a subject he returned to even after he had begun working in an abstract style after attending an exhibition of the Cubist paintings of Georges Braque and Pablo Picasso in 1911. Mondrian first sketched this farm around 1905. Nine of the twenty known related paintings and drawings of the farm, however, were created later, during World War I. Mondrian likely returned to the subject because his wartime patrons generally preferred his earlier naturalistic compositions to his recent experiments with Cubism.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/144467/farm-near-duivendrecht

The deceptively realistic blue curtain, painted by Frans van Mieris, refers to the historical strategy for protecting paintings but also to the tale of Parhassius, a skilled Greek artist who fooled his rival into attempting to pull back a curtain painted onto one of his pictures.

nl_12,Piet Mondrian,Oil on canvas,Composition (No. 1) Gray-Red,"The roots of 20th-century abstract art can be traced to the late 19th century, when artists began to move away from the direct representation of objects toward the communication of emotional states or moods. In doing so, the formal properties of art—such visual elements as line, color, and composition—assumed a primary role in its production. After World War I, many artists, including Piet Mondrian, believed that abstract art could contribute to a more harmonious society by communicating in a universal, visual language. In the wake of the war’s destruction, artists associated with De Stijl (meaning, “the style”) in the Netherlands recognized the need for a break with the past, as well as a new aesthetic language to correspond to their utopian vision of the world. In 1917 Mondrian joined the De Stijl movement and began to develop a purely visual language of verticals and horizontals, restricting his compositions to predominantly off-white grounds divided by black rectilinear lines that framed smaller blocks of primary colors.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/65821/composition-no-1-gray-red
nl_13,Dieric Bouts,Oil on panel,Mater Dolorosa (Sorrowing Virgin),"During the period of transition between the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, the great Netherlandish painters worked with traditional forms to create more human and emotional images for personal religious devotion. Paired images of the mourning Virgin and Christ crowned with thorns, made in the workshop of Dieric Bouts, were an especially successful formulation, judging from the many extant versions. Set against a gold background signifying a timeless, heavenly realm, the Virgin was both an embodiment of compassion and an intercessor for humankind with Christ. No autograph example of this pair by Bouts survives; this exceptionally fine painting of the Virgin was probably made by his son, Dieric Bouts the Younger, who carried on the activity of the workshop after his father’s death.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/110673/mater-dolorosa-sorrowing-virgin

The sitter appears frozen in a somewhat unnatural pose, as was the fashion for half-length portraits at the time, and the positioning of his left hand on the painting’s lower edge recalls the spatial illusionism found in portraits by Netherlandish artists of the previous generation. However, the subtle modeling of the face conveys a strong sense of the sitter’s individual character at a time when such works tended to idealize their subjects.

Pieter Claesz. was a leading painter of a type of still life often described as a “banquet piece,” which featured luxury foods and serving vessels, typically strewn across an elaborately dressed tabletop. These costly goods—like the lemon, olives, sweetmeats, and lace-edged damask tablecloth in this painting—were sometimes depicted in a state of decay to suggest the transitory nature of coveted earthly things.

He meandered with his camera through the jazz bars, cafés, and restaurants of Saint–Germain–des–Prés, producing a series of photographs that captured the rebellious youth culture of that time, later published as the book Love on the Left Bank. Shot in quick succession, these two street views show police dispersing a crowd of demonstrators and employ an aerial perspective that contrasts starkly with the casual intimacy found in most of Elsken’s images. Yet they reflect a parallel concern with the state of postwar French society, which he indicted as “bourgeois, individualistic, decadent, rotten and deadly … with nothing to offer its young people.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/5716/the-quick-and-the-dead
nl_18,Rembrandt van Rijn,"Etching, drypoint and burin in black on ivory laid paper",Self-Portrait Etching at a Window,"No artist has probed the potential of self-portraiture with greater tenacity and variety than Rembrandt. Over the course of his long career, he made over 80 self-portraits in oil, in chalk, in pen and ink and wash, and in etching. A large portion of these self-examinations were created while he was a young man, and served to spread his fame, his name and image, while advertising his abilities in portraiture and dramatic expression. But perhaps Rembrandt’s most soul-searching and moving images date from the end of his career, characteristically, his self-scrutiny was first considered carefully in etching, before being pursued in painting.Unpretentious, the image Self Portrait at a Window, Drawing on an Etching-Plate reflects a traditional portrait type used since the 15th century. Not striking a pose, the artist is caught in the middle of his most intimate and natural activity, etching on a plate resting on a folded piece of cloth on top of several books. In this particularly fine impression of the finished print, Rembrandt’s gaze rivets the viewer with a soul-searching energy that seems capable of fueling his late, great painted investigations.Noted Rembrandt scholar Mariët Westermann has observed “by its sheer extent, his portraiture production inaugurated a type of pictorial autobiography… including diaries, memoirs, and philosophical investigations” reflective of “the new valuation of the individual…underpinned by the Protestant Reformation.”[1] Philosopher René Descartes published his famous treatise on ‘the nature of the human self’ (‘I think, therefore I am’) in Rembrandt’s native Leiden in 1637. Westermann has conjectured that “Rembrandt’s incessant representation of his face and body suggests a Cartesian belief in the actuality and relevance of the self.”[2]When Rembrandt created Self-Portrait at a Window, Drawing on an Etching-Plate, in 1648, it had been nine years since his last major self-portrait etching, the arrogant and famous Self Portrait Leaning on a Sill of 1639, which echoed the Renaissance courtier portraits of Raphael and Titian. The reasons for this significant hiatus have been cause for speculation by various Rembrandt scholars. It had been a time of great turmoil for the artist: his son Titus was born in 1641, but in 1642 his beloved Saskia had died; Nursemaid Geertge Dircx’s insistence on marriage led to lawsuits throughout the decade, resulting in her incarceration. Finally the comforting companionship of Hendrickje Stoffels, introduced to the household about 1648, restored balance to Rembrandt’s life. Christopher White remarked on Rembrandt’s general reluctance to look at himself during the decade of the 1640s.[3] Perry Chapman suggested that Rembrandt’s sudden interest in landscape, about 1640, “coincided with his suspension of self-portrayal… the solitude of nature served as a alternative form of self-examination.”[4]Created just a year after the subtle and elegantly individual etched portraits of Jan Six and Ephraim Bonus of 1647, this self-portrait seems more sober and much more introspective. Wearing a plain black hat with high crown and simple studio tunic, the artist seems less gracious and slightly obdurate. Despite appearances, Rembrandt has not yet encountered sobering financial difficulties. It is worth noting that 1639, the year of that aggrandizing earlier self-portrait, was the year in which Rembrandt contracted to purchase his expensive house on the Sint Antonisbreestraat for 13,000 guilders. In 1647, his and Saskia’s marital estate had been estimated at 40,750 guilders, and the precipitous decline of his fortunes would not be apparent for several years. Therefore, Christopher White suggests “his new introspective mood must have been prompted by personal and artistic reasons, which must have inspired the magic of psychological interpretation. Earlier he had depicted himself from the outside inviting us to be his spectators, but now he studies himself from within, and we feel ourselves intruders in this frank and intimate self-analysis in a mirror, in which one is as near to reading the mind as is humanly possible in a visual medium. The look is piercingly powerful and we see the man himself and not his expression.”[5]Erik Hinterding noted that the image is built up less with lines than from a range of shades,[6] not unlike the elaborate gradations achieved in the portraits of Six and Bonus, or Rembrandt’s contemporary masterpiece, Christ Preaching, known as The Hundred Guilder Print. Thanks to eight known examples of the unfinished first state,[7] it is possible to study Rembrandt’s working method in creating such a complex medley of intaglio processes. He seems to have used etching to lay in the subject with a dense network of lines, but relied on drypoint to define the forms, and tiny flecks to suggest the face. Indeed, the lines of the visage may not have fully printed until the finished second state, in which in other areas he used a combination of etching, drypoint and engraving so well blended that no single method is easily apparent [8] Rembrandt even used the engraver’s burin to shade his left hand so that the cuff is highlighted, and a fine line of drypoint to outline the right arm and the window.In this second state, which Rembrandt finally deemed to be ready to go out into the world, he added a scrim of cloth at the top of the window on which he inscribed his name—an apt reminder of how important light always was for him as an artist, as well as how critical it was for him to be able to modulate the light in his workshop. Christopher White has said “in signing it, he must have been aware that he had completed one of the key works of this period of his life… though he made two more self-portraits in etching, this is undoubtedly the greatest and most searching. From now on, this analysis was to be seen in the moving series of painted self-portraits….”[9]Rembrandt made only minor corrections of additional burin work in the third state. In the fourth state the foul-biting apparent in the open window has been transformed into a landscape. Scholars are divided as to the authenticity of this landscape, but there is no question that the fifth state, already very dry and worn, is posthumous.10][1] Mariët Westermann, Rembrandt, London, 2000, pp. 9–11.[2] Op cit., p. 13.[3] Christopher White, Rembrandt as an Etcher, London, 1969, p. 132.[4] H.

The elaborate architectural carvings, on the other hand, recall ancient Roman wall decoration. Van Scorel likely made this work while traveling to study in Italy: the panel on which it is painted is made of fir, a wood rarely used in the Low Countries but one he might have encountered on his way across the Alps.

It was made in Gerard David’s Bruges workshop for export to Spain. Lamentation over the Body of Christ formed the center of a row of narrative scenes supporting the superstructure of the altarpiece following Spanish convention. Parts of the altarpiece are now divided between museums in Washington, D.C.; Toledo, Ohio; and Edinburgh, Scotland.

Brilliant Gloom depicts a view of a house in a murky, seemingly cosmic landscape with stitched-on plants and rocks that appear to float above the ground. A radiant grid of brightly colored lights hovers above the shadowy vista, vaguely reflected in the water.

The painting celebrates two aristocratic pastimes, jousting and hunting; Scorel used a 1506 woodcut by Lucas Cranach the Elder as the model for the lively crowd watching the joust. Italian patrons were particularly drawn to the Northern European vision of chivalric subjects and courtly pursuits, and the jousting theme was no doubt requested of the young Dutch painter, who showed a talent for combining small active figures in a landscape setting.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/110527/landscape-with-tournament-and-hunters

Anthony of Padua, an important early follower of Saint Francis, was more popular in Italy, Spain and Portugal than in the Low Countries, hence the diptych may have been made for a member of the large foreign community in Bruges.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/79777/saint-anthony-of-padua

The artist used iron gall ink made from the protective growth an oak tree produces after a wasp lays its eggs inside the tree branch. The ink is deep brown and almost black in some areas. Because iron gall ink contains a high concentration of tannic acid, however, it dissolves paper over time. Above the right foot of the Roma woman the damaged paper was repaired.On several occasions De Gheyn represented figures from the Roma or Romani community, itinerant members of Dutch society whose origins can be traced to northern India. Often finding shelter at the outskirts of cities, the Roma frequently took up informal trades like peddling and fortune telling.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/9505/two-studies-of-a-roma-woman-and-a-roma-boy-in-a-large-hat

The additional colors—together with the color of the paper itself—provide more definition to the forms and more dramatic light effects.The virtuoso graphic artist Hendrick Goltzius used the chiaroscuro woodcut technique to great effect in his depiction of Hercules completing the 10th of his 12 labors: the capture of the cattle of Geryon. To accomplish this feat, he had to vanquish the giant Cacus. Goltzius shows the moment just before Hercules violently clubs the giant, which is made especially dramatic by the vivid conjunction of yellow and green.Although Goltzius’s advances in line engraving found many followers, few artists pursued his equally original exploration of chiaroscuro woodcuts printed from one line block and multiple tone blocks.

He reduced bridges, churches, rivers, trees, and more to a series of horizontal and vertical black lines enclosing fields of unmixed red, blue, and yellow as well as white, black, and gray. This artistic idiom, eventually called Neoplasticism, removed naturalism from painting to reveal the essence of visual forms and provide viewers with a transcendental experience.While Mondrian’s abstractions may seem simple, he worked hard to achieve the dynamic yet harmonious balance between line and color. He labored over the location, spacing, and thickness of every line, making numerous charcoal sketches both on paper and directly on the canvas. Although not immediately related to any finished painting, Study for a Composition shows the artist’s obsession with the density and placement of line and the number, size, and location of color fields. Here, he collaged red and blue papers to the sheet to examine their weight and position in relation to other elements.

Since she began exhibiting her photographic work in 1993, she has developed an international reputation as one of the most visible and highly regarded Dutch artists of her generation. She is known for flat, frontal, color portraits of individuals that are characterized by a remarkable formal classicism, conceptual rigor, and psychological depth. Of her work, the artist has commented, “I discovered that if you want to give a general impression, you should be very specific.” In the series Beach Portraits, for instance, she depicts her subjects within a precise geographic setting yet avoids identifying them by name.Although video is somewhat of an anomaly in Dijkstra’s oeuvre, her earliest attempts in the medium, like her photographs, focus on the tender aspects of teenage sexuality and social behavior. For instance, both Buzz Club/Mysteryworld (1997) and Annemiek, February 11, 1997 feature subjects that were filmed alone or in groups, appearing before a blank white background. Buzz Club, however, grounds these individuals within their wider location—a nightclub in Liverpool—through the use of ambient noise as well as through their unselfconsciousness in front of the camera; although they stand in front of a screen, they continue to smoke, dance, and chew gum. In this way, Buzz Club serves as a stylistic and compositional bridge between Dijsktra’s photographic portraits and Annemiek.Dijkstra shot Annemiek with a single fixed camera, and only the subject’s head and shoulders are visible in the frame. The work features an adolescent Dutch girl alone before the camera, lip-synching the ballad “I Wanna Be With You” by the popular American teen band the Backstreet Boys. As the music starts, Annemiek appears nervous and embarrassed, but only moments later she furrows her brow in a momentary lapse of self-consciousness, allowing herself to imitate the lyrics’ passion. Quickly catching herself, she manages a bashful smile.

Its light and dark contrasts form an overall geometrical pattern, like a chessboard run amok, or a jigsaw puzzle writhing with mutating pieces. The creatures may not be far removed from Hieronymus Bosch’s Renaissance-era views of the underworld, but Escher’s claustrophobic, patterned landscape is also full of delight.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/118256/plane-filling-i

Made from an enlarged three-dimensional digital recording of the microscopic mucus particles emitted during a sneeze, this vase was constructed from layers of polyamide powder fused together by heat from a laser beam using rapid prototyping technology.

The theater already had a tradition of teaching from prints during dissections. In 1598, its founder, Professor Pieter Pauw, had forty prints after Vesalius framed and pasted onto a board for the walls of the theater. The flap broadsides were likely used in a similar didactic manner. Pauw also installed skeletons (visible in the background) and skulls (under the table) to educate his students as well as decorate the space and remind spectators of their impending demise.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/51094/the-anatomical-lesson-of-professor-pauw

Shot in quick succession, these two street views show police dispersing a crowd of demonstrators and employ an aerial perspective that contrasts starkly with the casual intimacy found in most of Elsken’s images. Yet they reflect a parallel concern with the state of postwar French society, which he indicted as “bourgeois, individualistic, decadent, rotten and deadly … with nothing to offer its young people.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/5719/the-quick-and-the-dead

Maharam often commissions designs from practitioners whose primary work lies outside textile design—an approach that results in a wide range of critical artistic engagements with the medium. Hella Jongerius’s 2002 Repeat Dot takes inspiration from her close observation of the manufacturing process in textile mills producing Maharam designs. Focusing on the technology and by-products used to create woven fabrics, this work recalls the perforations of punch cards used to program Jacquard looms, overlaid with white screen-printing that mimics the codes and handwritten notes used to make changes to fabric samples. Her Repeat series also has a unique means of application as the repeats of different patterns of the design occur at wide intervals, offering users a level of customization by choosing to use one or more of the patterns in a single piece of fabric.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/189609/repeat-textile

Extracting the faces of Laocoön’s sons from the sculptural ensemble and reversing their left-to-right order, Goltzius blended the red chalk to emphasize the protruding volumes of the neck muscles.

For instance, the “plunger” serves as both a cup handle and the spout of a coffee pot.

After serving for a decade, Cipriano fled and survived the first organized persecution of Christians by the Romans.

For instance, the “plunger” serves as both a cup handle and the spout of a coffee pot.

Francis commissioned this sculpture of the mythological woodland creature to go over the main entryway to the château. While differently composed than the relief, this print retains the detail of the spilling water vase, the nymph’s languorous posture, and the plenitude of animals. Closely following the sculpture, the woodcut even places the antlered stag at dead center.

The two longest foldouts in the book showed Venice and the culminating destination of Jerusalem, a city central to all three major Abrahamic religions.

The supple, translucent flesh demonstrates the interest in naturalism that blossomed in Northern Europe in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, which led artists to work increasingly “from life,” that is, from observation of models.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/256795/venus-cupid-and-ceres

Here, Christ is shown miraculously appearing above the altar at right, in front of Gregory kneeling amid his startled congregation.

Heda’s still life may look like a snapshot of an abandoned meal, but the scene is carefully arranged, revealing the artist’s ability to create complex but harmonious compositions. Heda used the pewter chargers as horizontal elements in the foreground and the glass vessels and salt-cellar as verticals in the background, with the overturned ewer positioned diagonally to connect the two planes. Faint creases in the tablecloth, plates hanging precariously off the table’s edge, and the window reflected on the pitcher’s surface demonstrate the artist’s observant eye as well as his virtuosity in handling paint. Executed in a limited palette of silvers, grays, and browns, this work is an example of the “tonal trend” in Dutch 17th-century painting.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/257286/breakfast-still-life

Here, the hulking Alpheus climbs the riverbank in pursuit of the stout nymph, who looks back in fear as she flees. With his lush landscapes and unidealized figures, Uyttenbroeck belonged to the generation of artists who influenced the young Rembrandt van Rijn. Their work inspired the dramatic poses and gestures that Rembrandt adopted as a means of conveying emotion.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/257287/alpheus-and-arethusa

The architectural proposal resolves an aesthetic and spatial disjunction between Kukje Gallery’s contemporary and dynamic artist roster and the surrounding neighborhood of Samcheong-ro, the latter marked by historic buildings patterned with a fabric of diverse materials and construction techniques. Deeming the diagrammatic box geometry too rigid for the setting, SO–IL enveloped the structure in a mesh veil, creating a nebulous surface that changes appearance as visitors move through the site.

Fernhout’s turn to still photography was informed by his political commitments, including to the Communist-affiliated Association of Worker Photographers. Although the five images in this series depicting chimney sweeps read like a storyboard for a short film, they were likely intended for magazine publication. By combining arresting views with a variety of narrative emphases—in one, a man seems to dance across the tiles; in another, he cleans diligently; in a third, two chimney sweeps confer—Fernhout conveys the dangers of this occupation without blindly heroizing his subjects.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/236310/chimney-sweep

Fernhout’s turn to still photography was informed by his political commitments, including to the Communist-affiliated Association of Worker Photographers. Although the five images in this series depicting chimney sweeps read like a storyboard for a short film, they were likely intended for magazine publication. By combining arresting views with a variety of narrative emphases—in one, a man seems to dance across the tiles; in another, he cleans diligently; in a third, two chimney sweeps confer—Fernhout conveys the dangers of this occupation without blindly heroizing his subjects.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/236312/chimney-sweep

Mezzotint was a relatively new intaglio process in which the artist burnished out highlights and gradations, effectively erasing the darkness, from a completely roughened copper plate that would print black if left untouched. In the final state the artist added stars, as well as more definition to the clouds and landscape, and intensified the highlights of the figures and their respective objects (the staff of the Saint, and the world held by the Christ-child). The result is a tonally richer composition.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/191342/saint-christopher
