ger_1,Gerhard Richter,Oil on canvas,Woman Descending the Staircase (Frau die Treppe herabgehend),"Throughout his career, Gerhard Richter has alternated between figuration and abstraction. Woman Descending the Staircase is one of Richter’s photo paintings, figurative works in which the artist transferred found photographs, such as personal snapshots or media images, onto canvas and then dragged a dry brush through the wet pigment, thus blurring the image and rendering the forms elusive. Here, the slightly out-of-focus quality reinforces the motion of an unknown, glamorously dressed woman descending a set of stairs. The work’s silver-blue brushwork suits the elegance of the subject with her glistening evening gown and diaphanous scarf. The composition’s subject and title evoke Marcel Duchamp’s famous work Nude Descending a Staircase (1912; Philadelphia Museum of Art). When it was exhibited in the United States at the 1913 Armory Show, Duchamp’s painting shocked Americans for its radical abstraction. Rather than honoring this modernist icon, Richter protested it, stating that he “could never accept that it had put [an end], once and for all, to a certain kind of painting.” Indeed, in the Art Institute’s work, Richter produced a hauntingly sophisticated image that floats between reality and illusion.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/147003/woman-descending-the-staircase-frau-die-treppe-herabgehend
ger_2,Vasily Kandinsky,Oil on canvas,Improvisation No. 30 (Cannons),"In his 1912 book Concerning the Spiritual in Art, Vasily Kandinsky made an analogy between music and painting as two means of abstraction, a radical mode of artmaking that freed color and line from their traditionally representational functions. Between 1910 and 1914 he produced “improvisations,” works he described as unconscious, spontaneous expressions. Kandinsky commented on Improvisation No. 30 (Cannons) in a letter to Arthur Jerome Eddy, a friend and collector from Chicago: “The cannons … could probably be explained by the constant war talk going on through the year [but] the true contents are what the spectator experiences while under the effect of the forms and color combinations of the picture.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/8991/improvisation-no-30-cannons
ger_3,Carl Blechen,Oil on canvas,The Interior of the Palm House on the Pfaueninsel Near Potsdam,"Lush palms and overgrown greenery dominate this view of the Palm House, a country estate designed by Karl Friedrich Schinkel to display the Prussian royals’ collection of tropical plants. This painting plays with the boundaries between architecture and nature, imagination and reality: vines curl around soaring columns and bowed fronds evoke archways. Carl Blechen populated his dazzlingly specific place-portrait with a leisure scene derived from colonialist fantasies of non-European women. The artist dressed the figures in rich textiles that echo the building’s colors and motifs, as if he considered them an extension of the décor.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/144969/the-interior-of-the-palm-house-on-the-pfaueninsel-near-potsdam
ger_4,Paul Klee,Oil on canvas,Sunset,"Paul Klee was an artist and teacher at the Bauhaus for most of that famed school’s existence. Initially head of the bookbinding department, Klee made his greatest contribution as a lecturer on the theory of form in art for the basic design course. There, he developed his ideas about the “polyphony” of painting—the simultaneous effect of formal elements that produces “a transformed beholder of art.”Klee was also a trained musician and shared with many artists of the early twentieth century the idea that music was the key to producing a new, abstract art. He was interested in the temporal character of music and its possible translation into forms of art. Works like Sunset reflect the principles of rhythm: linear structures, forms, and tonal values are orchestrated into a measured, vibrating image. To produce such a harmonious effect, Klee layered an intricate pattern of dots over a neutral background. Abstract, geometric, and overlapping shapes balance with recognizable forms, such as the schematic face in the upper left and the red sun and arrow in the lower right. The resulting composition—balancing stillness and movement, shallowness and depth—relates to Klee’s larger project of looking to music to produce an art that “does not reproduce the visible, but makes visible.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/61608/sunset
ger_5,Max Beckmann,Oil on canvas,Self-Portrait,"Max Beckmann was one of the Weimar Republic’s most honored artists and one of those most vilified by the Nazis. This self-portrait was perhaps the last painting the artist completed in Berlin before he and his wife fled to the Netherlands on July 20, 1937. Their flight occurred just two days after Adolf Hitler delivered a speech condemning modern art and one day after the opening of the exhibition Degenerate Art, the Nazis’ official denigration of the avant-garde, which included twenty-two of Beckmann’s works. The artist departed Germany just in time: in 1937 more than five hundred of his works were confiscated from public collections.The most brilliantly colored and aggressive of all of Beckmann’s self-portraits (he painted over eighty), this powerful work depicts the artist, near life size, on the staircase of a hotel lobby, separated from two figures in the background on the right. Beckmann steps to the left, while his dark-rimmed gaze and the entire picture plane—curtains, flowers, staircase, and banisters—seem to slide off to the right. His large hands hang down, limp, against his black tuxedo.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/84241/self-portrait
ger_6,Caspar David Friedrich,"Brush and black ink and gray wash, with graphite, on cream wove paper",Statue of the Madonna in the Mountains,"This vast landscape by one of the central figures of German Romanticism dates from Caspar David Friedrich’s early years in Dresden, where he settled after studying in Copenhagen (then considered the artistic center of northern Europe). Subtly graded shades of gray wash evoke the gloomy, overcast days so common in Germany in November, when this image was created. The drawing also conveys, in the artist’s words, “Not only what he sees before him, but also what he sees within him.” In the center of the landscape, atop the highest peak, a tiny pilgrim kneels in prayer at the base of a statue of the Madonna. Nature—with its sheer, blank sky, stark hills, and mute firs—is depicted almost religiously. In this deeply spiritual image, humankind’s experience of nature seems as overwhelming as the unfathomable mystery of our existence. Just as the infinitesimal pilgrim wanders in this faraway, expansive landscape, so too did the artist embark upon his own Romantic quest, a search for meaning in the natural world that reveals the sacred.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/50276/statue-of-the-madonna-in-the-mountains
ger_7,Johann Joachim Kändler,"Hard-paste porcelain, polychrome enamels",King Vulture,"As elector of Saxony and king of Poland, Augustus II (r. 1694/97–1733) presided over the ambitious transformation of his capital, Dresden, through advances in architecture, the arts, science, and technology. Produced beginning in 1710 through royal sponsorship and funding, Meissen porcelain was an exclusive luxury good of its time. Around 1728 Augustus conceived of replicating the animal kingdom in porcelain for display in a Baroque palace that he was transforming into a showcase for his collections of Asian and Meissen ceramics. This porcelain zoo was intended for the long gallery on the main floor of the palace. By 1733, the year the king died, more than thirty different models of birds and almost forty animals had been made, many by the sculptor Johann Joachim Kändler, who worked at Meissen from 1731 to 1775. Kändler drew this vulture from life, which allowed him to animate his work with the creature’s quintessential spirit. Such porcelain animals remain the most vivid expression of Augustus’s wish, as elector and king, to possess and rule over the natural world.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/189715/king-vulture
ger_8,,Ivory with traces of gold,Triptych with Scenes from the Life of Christ,"Ivory was used to make highly prized devotional objects in the Gothic era. This triptych features scenes from the infancy and Passion of Christ, arranged in a chronological sequence from left to right, starting at the bottom with the Annunciation, the Adoration of the Magi, and the Presentation in the Temple. The narrative continues in the top register with the Road to Calvary, Christ on the Cross, and the encounter of Christ and Mary Madgalen after the Resurrection. Such small devotional objects might be kept on a stand or cabinet in a bedroom, ready to be used as a focus for prayer by the layperson who owned them, along with an illuminated Psalter or Book of Hours. The intimate scale and movable wings of the triptych made it easy to store in a chest or to carry from one residence to another as needed. Although Paris has long been recognized as a great center for ivory carving in the Gothic era, recent scholarship has also emphasized the importance of workshops in England, Germany, and Italy—affirming the popularity of the medium throughout medieval Europe. This triptych was most likely made by a master artist and his atelier working in Germany, probably in Cologne.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/25332/triptych-with-scenes-from-the-life-of-christ
ger_9,Katharina Fritsch,Polyester and paint; edition number two of two with one artist's proof,Monk (Mönch),"Katharina Fritsch roots her work in the personal, often drawing from childhood memories of familiar circumstances or chance encounters. At the same time, her references engage broad aspects of German folklore and culture through meticulous reproductions of quotidian objects, many of which she formally manipulates with shifts in scale and color. Her process is intensely time-consuming: molded by hand, each object is cast in plaster, reworked, and cast again, often in polyester or aluminum. The completed forms are then painted with highly saturated, matte, nonreflective colors that create a sense of otherworldliness. In Monk the artist took up the lone, brooding figure of a friar to encapsulate her fascination with Christian traditions and rituals and the mysterious medieval towns, such as Nuremberg and Bamberg, that she frequented in her youth.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/154232/monk-monch
ger_10,Thomas Struth,"Chromogenic print mounted to acrylic, edition number three of ten","Art Institute of Chicago II, Chicago","As a student of the renowned photographers Bernd and Hilla Becher at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf in the 1970s, Thomas Struth absorbed their objective, methodical style of making pictures, often emphasizing the camera’s single-point perspective. To his varied subject matter—city streets, rainforests, family portraits—Struth brings an acute awareness of the act of observation. His use of relatively great depth of field allows him to lead the viewer’s eye to certain details and gloss over other ones.Struth’s celebrated Museum Photographs series is composed of monumental images of museum visitors in various stages of observation, captivation, and even distraction. As part of this series, Art Institute of Chicago II depicts a woman pushing a stroller facing Gustave Caillebotte’s famous Paris Street; Rainy Day, while another woman reads the label. The women’s clothing harmonizes remarkably with the palette of the painting, and the gallery’s marble floor seems transformed into a continuation of the wet cobblestones rendered so believably by Caillebotte’s paintbrush. As historian Hans Belting concluded of this work, “One no longer knows what is inside the painting and what is in front of it… . We feel like rubbing our eyes when the space in front of the painting transforms itself into a picture that is not separated from the painting.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/117271/art-institute-of-chicago-ii-chicago
ger_11,Sigmar Polke,Resin and acrylic paint on various fabrics,Watchtower with Geese (Hochsitz mit Gänsen),"Sigmar Polke was born in Silesia (present-day Poland), which became part of East Germany after World War II. He moved to West Germany in the 1960s, becoming one of a number of German artists who sought to confront the collective trauma that characterized the history of their nation in the 20th century. The watchtower referred to in the title may indicate a type of elevated seat frequently used in the German countryside as a lookout when hunting fowl, a reference underscored by a gaggle of geese in the painting’s right-hand corner. The designs on the black fabric evoke the pleasures of leisure time at a beach and provide an association with another kind of raised chair, that of a lifeguard. But, more ominously, the watchtower is also related to guard towers, prisons, concentration camps, and walled countries.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/76054/watchtower-with-geese-hochsitz-mit-gansen
ger_12,Albrecht Dürer,Pen and black ink on ivory laid paper,Young Bull,"From an early age, Albrecht Dürer displayed an inquisitive mind and exceptional talent as a draftsman. He was born in Nuremberg and first trained as a goldsmith in his father’s shop before apprenticing with the painter Michael Wolgemut. One of his earliest animal drawings, Young Steer shows its subject grazing in an unseen field. The artist’s sure strokes and adept cross-hatching delineate the steer’s sculptural form, with taut skin stretched over a strong yet bony frame. Dürer’s precise draftsmanship recalls the drawings and prints of the celebrated German master Martin Schongauer, whom he greatly admired. This work was probably a study from nature; sketchy lines around the animal’s right hind foot, back, muzzle, and horns reveal that the artist originally drew the steer in a slightly different position, with his mouth open. A masterful engraver who would elevate printmaking to an expressive art form over the course of his career, Dürer employed the steer’s hindquarters for the barnyard scene in his engraving The Prodigal Son amid the Swine (1494/96), an impression of which is in the Art Institute.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/23506/young-bull
ger_13,Georg Baselitz,Charcoal and synthetic resin on linen,Woodman (Waldarbeiter),"During the early 1960s, Georg Baselitz began producing representational images—characterized by thickly painted surfaces and often emotional and/or tragic themes—that drew inspiration from Germany’s artistic and cultural heritage. Between 1967 and 1969, Baselitz executed a series of Fracture Paintings, in which he segmented his subjects—animals, shepherds, and woodsmen—into horizontal bands or irregular fragments. Strung up sideways against a massive tree trunk, this woodsman heralded the artist’s trademark inverted figures, which first appeared soon after this painting’s completion. Conjuring a world gone mad, Woodman evokes the psychic and physical disorientation Germans experienced after their war-torn nation was partitioned in 1946. Indeed, Baselitz created this work after he left a divided Berlin to reside in a small German village.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/68823/woodman-waldarbeiter
ger_14,Ernst Ludwig Kirchner,Color woodcut with charcoal on cream wove paper,Portrait of Otto Mueller,"Ernst Ludwig Kirchner’s Portrait of Otto Mueller—with its vibrant, modulated color and penetrating psychological force—is emblematic of the artist’s innovative approach to technique and imagery. A pivotal figure of the German Expressionist movement, Kirchner first met Mueller, also a painter-printmaker, in 1910. Mueller then joined Die Brücke (The Bridge), the group Kirchner had helped found in 1905, which was instrumental in promoting Expressionism. The period between 1915 and 1919 marked Kirchner’s most concentrated and productive phase of work with portrait prints, which he made primarily as large-format woodcuts. In this depiction of Mueller, Kirchner used a spare, planar composition and broad areas of undifferentiated color to depict his subject’s sharp features. He painted on a single block with a brush and varying colors; thus, each print is unique. The cobalt-blue striated forms that emanate from the figure’s right and from the side of his head in this print are abstract representations of the painted bands that decorated Kirchner’s studio wall, against which Mueller posed. These bands, which Kirchner painted himself, exemplify his adoption of motifs and styles from Palauan art of the South Pacific and resonate with Mueller’s own fondness for African-inspired furniture and wall paintings. Indeed, his hieratic, frontal position may suggest his interest in Egyptian art.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/72726/portrait-of-otto-mueller
ger_15,Lovis Corinth,"Gouache, with possible additions in oil, on heavy ivory wove paper",Self-Portrait,"“The times are not the same for us old folk anymore,” reads a 1923 diary entry by Lovis Corinth, who suffered a stroke in 1911 and never quite recovered. “We have lost our way … so sad, so very sad.” The following year, the artist created this tortured self-image; he was sixty-five, with one year left to live. An inveterate self-portraitist, Corinth produced more images of himself than almost any other artist except Rembrandt van Rijn. In this haunting gouache, he gazes at the viewer in anguish. The brooding palette portrays a deeply shadowed face— contorted, haggard, and sunk into hunched shoulders. The pain that both the diary entry and this portrait convey is curiously at odds with Corinth’s professional life, which had, in fact, been successful. Challenging traditional approaches to art, his early figure compositions, with their overt sexuality and theatrical movements, made his reputation. Later he executed intensely colored, windswept landscapes that became his most popular works. But Corinth was a deeply patriotic man, and his personal accomplishments failed to assuage the torment he experienced after Germany’s humiliation in World War I and his despair over the values of the Weimar Republic that followed.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/70202/self-portrait
ger_16,Master of the Housebook,Drypoint in black on ivory laid paper,The Road to Calvary,"This dramatic depiction of Christ’s suffering on his way to the Crucifixion is one of the first examples of drypoint by the anonymous master who invented this method of engraving. In drypoint the image is drawn directly on a metal plate with a sharp instrument, a process that preserves the artist’s personal “handwriting” and imparts to the print a characteristically velvety line. Here the printmaker skillfully exploited the soft, atmospheric effects, silvery shadows, and sense of delicate, luminous distances that are attainable in drypoint. The forest of lances that juts up behind the hills in the background also creates the illusion of depth. The central motif is Christ’s ordeal at the hands of three soldiers who force him and Simon of Cyrene, an innocent bystander, onward to the Mount of Calvary. On the left, the grieving figure of Mary, supported by the apostle John, is strikingly juxtaposed with the utterly indifferent soldier on the right, who has turned his back on the whole scene. This impression of The Road to Calvary is one of only three versions of this print. The Rijksprenten kabinet in Amsterdam owns eighty of the approximately ninety surviving prints by his hand.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/110881/the-road-to-calvary
ger_17,Henry van de Velde (Designer),Silvered brass and teak,Samovar,"The Belgian architect and designer Henry van de Velde was one of the primary exponents of Art Nouveau, an international design style informed by the English Arts and Crafts Movement that was born in the 1880s and flourished at the turn of the twentieth century. This samovar, or Russian teakettle, beautifully illustrates the adroit mixture of taut lines and curvilinear motifs that characterizes Van de Velde’s mature Art Nouveau style. The sinuous organic lines of its base twist and snake around upright brackets and pick up again in the braided band motif of the teak handle. The kettle itself is simple in form, unornamented, and, with a prominent hinge on the spout cover, appears to be more engineered than crafted. This example was made from silvered brass and teak in accord with Van de Velde’s philosophy that art should be accessible and affordable to a broad public (though other examples were made of more costly silver). The kettle was designed at the Weimar School of Applied Arts, where Van de Velde became director in 1904. That school later became the Bauhaus, the bastion of modern design.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/111400/samovar
ger_18,Thomas Schütte,Terra-cotta and porcelain,Urns (Set of 8),"Avoiding any signature style, Thomas Schütte has produced an oeuvre of perplexing diversity, including architectural models, photographs, sculpture, and watercolor drawings. His decidedly unimposing, antiheroic works explore the cultural, economic, historical, and social conditions of his native Germany with a detached, often humorous, sensibility. Much of Schütte’s work addresses the almost existential difficulty postwar German artists encounter in attempting to create monuments and memorials. As such, it evidences an ongoing preoccupation with themes of death, mourning, and collective memory. This is true of Urns, an installation comprising eight ceramic vessels glazed in a palette of solid colors marked by streaks, drips, and other surface effects. Ranging from three to five feet in height, these fragile containers at once imply living bodies and oversize repositories for their ashes. The vessels are intended to be grouped together, like a family. Displayed closed, these mysterious containers prompt speculation about what might be contained inside. One of the urns, however, lacks a top and bottom; viewing the installation from above reveals that it is empty.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/182728/urns-set-of-8

Marc painted The Bewitched Mill following a sojourn to the Italian town of Merano in the southern Tirol.

Between 1937 and 1940, however, Klee regained artistic momentum and produced several hundred paintings and over 1,500 drawings.

Often working in a common palette using expressive brushwork, they shared a belief in the symbolic and spiritual importance of forms and colors, including their effect on emotions and memories. Blaue Reiter also promoted a spontaneous, intuitive approach to painting, looking to non-Western, European medieval, and folk art for inspiration.

The tight curves on the brow suggest the figure is concentrating, while the tension between the nose and mouth, which pull in opposite directions, conveys anxiety. In contrast to the cheerful pink cheeks, the figure’s tear-shaped eyes communicate distress.

Despite the denunciation of his work, Nolde maintained his affiliation with the Nazis throughout the war. While Max Beckmann and Marc Chagall, whose works are on view on adjacent walls, were forced to defect from Europe and Otto Dix was arrested as an “unreliable intellectual” for his anti-fascist protests, Nolde remained aligned with the Nazis.

In lectures, Klee developed his ideas about the “polyphony” of painting, which was based on his interest in simultaneous sensational effects that could be created by various layered formal elements.

Sander categorized his subjects within a personally constructed social hierarchy, ranging from artists and farmers to beggars and the mentally ill. Otto Dix was a well-known painter whose work had led Sander to reassess his earlier portraiture and broaden its scope. This photograph appears in the section on women, alongside several portraits of artists and their wives; in contrast to the frontal poses usually found in his images of couples, in these Sander presented one spouse in profile.— Permanent collection labelThe portraits of August Sander are notable for their directness and freedom from the stiff decorum common to studio portraiture of his day. After working for many years as an itinerant photographer, Sander developed a quasi-scientific project in the 1920s to catalogue representatives of German society. Influenced by the work of painters such as Otto Dix, his subject here, this venture led Sander to reassess his earlier portraits and broaden the scope of his portraiture. Launching his project in 1927, Sander described his aim “to see things as they are and not as they should or might be … to tell the truth about our age and people.” Dix, who had recently published The War, a portfolio of gruesome etchings, similarly aspired to a detached recording of momentous events: “I … had to see how someone next to me suddenly fell and was gone, the bullet hitting him right in the middle.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/144605/the-painter-otto-dix-and-his-wife-martha

The theme posed an enticing challenge for artists, with its burning leaves, billowing plumes of smoke, and active facial expressions—here, the figure purses his lips and wrinkles his brow as he concentrates on lighting the pipe.

This print bears an inscription that translates to “The noble bees draw honey from the beautiful flower; from this one however, the frivolous vermin extract a stronger potion.” The ripe blossom thus symbolizes sexual consummation, and the print simultaneously tempts and warns the viewer about “the birds and bees.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/3818/ornament-with-flower-and-eight-wild-folk

The weekly magazine, founded to popularize news and images from a working-class viewpoint, served from the first as a major organ of opposition to the rising National Socialist Party. When Hitler took power in early 1933, Heartfield and the AIZ editorial office fled to Prague; many of Heartfield’s best-known covers for the magazine were made in the Czech capital. Among them is this iconic picture of a monumental fist that contains a multitude of arms raised in solidarity. The composition, exceptional for Heartfield in that it shows a picture of inspiration rather than acerbic critique, was undoubtedly influenced by the work of Soviet photomontage artist Gustav Klutsis, particularly a 1932 election poster for which Klutsis repeated the image of his own raised palm numerous times to evoke a crowd acting as one. In 2009 the Art Institute acquired a premier collection of Central and Eastern European photography in print that includes 163 issues of AIZ—one of the largest such holdings in the United States—and many other books, periodicals, and posters by both Heartfield and Klutsis.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/199245/a-i-z-workers-illustrated-magazine

Both Jegher’s and Rubens’s names appear, with the privilege (an early form of copyright), at the lower right of the dramatic Hercules Slaying Envy.

In 1979 Appelt left the opera company to focus on visual arts. He has since produced a large body of photographs, often based in sculpture or performance and with himself as a subject, exploring themes of death, rebirth, and suffering. The title of this photograph is a quote from the 1910 novel Impressions of Africa (Impressions d’Afrique) by the French poet and playwright Raymond Roussel, whose fantastical and bizarre works were praised by his Surrealist contemporaries. This line—with its reference to mark-making, time, and ephemerality—has served Appelt as inspiration for his photographic work in general.

Pan’s frustrated sigh sounded across the hollow reeds, which he then fashioned into the set of pipes that became his attribute. This 16th-century German drawing references details from book one of Ovid’s Metamorphoses such as the quiver Syrinx grasps as she escapes: “When [Pan] thought he now had Syrinx, found that instead of the nymph’s body he only held reeds from the marsh; and, while he sighed there, the wind in the reeds, moving, gave out a clear, plaintive sound.

Originally trained as a painter (he studied with Gerhard Richter), he was one of a notable group of students mentored in photography by Berndt and Hilla Becher at the Kunstakademie Düsseldorf. Between 1995 and 2002, Struth visited China four times, fascinated by that country’s historic landscapes and busy city streets. Whereas his earlier black and white photographs of cities were rigorously centered and eerily devoid of inhabitants, this photograph of a bustling Wuhan market is chaotically dense, colorful, and filled with people.

Tillmans often juxtaposes unframed images of varying sizes and formats, placing inkjet prints alongside glossy chromogenic prints, and recombining material from prior installations with new work. As the artist explained, “half my work is in the photograph, and half is in the installation.” This configuration, designed specifically for the Art Institute, presents a selection of images taken between 1993 and 2003, intermingling ephemeral moments of contemporary life with abstract studies of surface textures. Tillmans subverts traditional photographic hierarchies by focusing on complex interrelationships between images and the materiality of photographic objects.

The waterline is only ankle-deep for the standing figures, while the seated pair in the foreground is more submerged; a Dürer look-alike controls the strategically placed pump. This large-scale woodcut was published shortly after a 1496 edict closed the bathhouses in Dürer’s hometown of Nuremberg, around the time of both an outbreak of syphilis and a drought.

It is the only one with a clear narrative and the only one in which the blank scrolls in the upper corners are replaced with imagery: the distaff, used to spin thread and emblematic of feminine pursuits, and a demon who encourages the fight.

He constructed his first doll in 1933, inspired by a combination of childhood nostalgia and obscene fantasy. The result was a life-size assemblage of interchangeable body parts adorned with girlish garments and wigs. Bellmer, who had worked as a graphic designer, arguably deployed his erotic imaginings against the conventions of advertising as well as the Nazi obsession with hardened male bodies and the idealized physique. He began obsessively deconstructing, reconstructing, and photographing his doll and publishing the prints in art books and magazines. Encouraged by the Surrealists, who praised his work, Bellmer began a second doll two years later, a version of which is shown in this photograph; it can be seen as provocatively feminine and childish, or disturbingly dismembered and incomplete.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/119250/untitled

The images are presented in a grid, to emphasize both formal differences and overall sameness. Although the Bechers were greatly influenced by the reductive, serial formats common in Minimalist and Conceptual Art of the 1960s, Hilla once explained, “Our idea of showing the material has much more to do with the 19th century, with the encyclopedic approach used in botany or zoology, where … species are compared with one another on the individual pages of the lexicon.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/109688/pitheads-perspective-views

Through such images Umbo’s work was linked to the avant-garde interest in animated puppets or automatons as surrogates for human desire, an interest cultivated by German writers and artists in the 1910s and 1920s and embraced by the nascent Surrealist movement in the mid-1920s.

Stam–Beese’s hazy portrait of fellow textile student Elizabeth (Lis) Beyer— who later married Hans Volger, another Bauhaus student—transforms a casual snapshot into a bold artistic composition. By dramatically cropping Beyer within a diagonal and abstracting most of her body behind a frosted windowpane, Stam–Beese lent an emphatic sense of lift and movement to the picture.

An average middle-class family is being tortured for no apparent reason by both well-dressed members of German society, like the man in the center, and a working-class figure in a cap at the right. Beckmann revealed, seemingly without comment, the randomness of violence, as well as its everyday quality (exemplified by the “normal” interior).

The viewer could dissect its male and female corpses as an educational medical exercise or purely out of morbid curiosity. The first sheet, or Vision, boasts male and female flap figures after Dürer’s 1504 Adam and Eve engraving. The second and third Visions display larger-scale images of Adam and Eve respectively, each standing on a skull with its own flaps. The medical doctor Johann Remmelin, who designed these flap prints as a student, coyly denied responsibility for the 1613 edition until the single-sheet prints appeared to be selling. Then he blessed the reuse of his “unripe fruit” as book illustrations.Perhaps uniquely for flap prints of this era, eighteenth-century restrikes from the plates for the 1619 second state are known. These show how tightly Kilian organized the interior flaps for printing. The etched organ flaps were cut out and pasted on the backs of the main engraved images, which were cut open, forming yet more flaps. Each constructed impression has survived in a different arrangement and bears signs of viewer interaction. The series elicited strong reactions due to its heady mix of allegorical iconography and Vesalian anatomy, made ever more potent by the removable organs and naked flesh. Indeed, an unidentified brown substance was applied to Eve’s genital area under two sets of modesty flaps—an unusual gesture of censorship, or perhaps prayer for offspring.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/51195/first-vision-from-mirrors-of-the-microcosm

In the 1960s he began taking photographs while also amassing images made by others; his presentations often mix the two groups indiscriminately. It would presumably be hard for the artist to know what music was playing in a car photographed by someone else, let alone to judge its quality: “good music,” like fine art, is for the beholder or listener to assess. This evocative set of pictures nevertheless uses the silent, static medium of photography to convey the easy pleasure of listening to music while driving.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/202302/pictures-of-car-radios-taken-while-good-music-was-playing-ansichten-von-autoradios-in-denen-gerade-gute-musik-spielt

The viewer could dissect its male and female corpses as an educational medical exercise or purely out of morbid curiosity. The first sheet, or Vision, boasts male and female flap figures after Dürer’s 1504 Adam and Eve engraving. The second and third Visions display larger-scale images of Adam and Eve respectively, each standing on a skull with its own flaps. The medical doctor Johann Remmelin, who designed these flap prints as a student, coyly denied responsibility for the 1613 edition until the single-sheet prints appeared to be selling. Then he blessed the reuse of his “unripe fruit” as book illustrations.Perhaps uniquely for flap prints of this era, eighteenth-century restrikes from the plates for the 1619 second state are known. These show how tightly Kilian organized the interior flaps for printing. The etched organ flaps were cut out and pasted on the backs of the main engraved images, which were cut open, forming yet more flaps. Each constructed impression has survived in a different arrangement and bears signs of viewer interaction. The series elicited strong reactions due to its heady mix of allegorical iconography and Vesalian anatomy, made ever more potent by the removable organs and naked flesh. Indeed, an unidentified brown substance was applied to Eve’s genital area under two sets of modesty flaps—an unusual gesture of censorship, or perhaps prayer for offspring.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/51000/second-vision-from-mirrors-of-the-microcosm

This monumental undertaking, to which Sander gave the name People of the Twentieth Century, eventually grew to include more than 600 portraits (and thousands of poses) that formed a “physiognomical time exposure of German man,” in the photographer’s words.

The viewer could dissect its male and female corpses as an educational medical exercise or purely out of morbid curiosity. The first sheet, or Vision, boasts male and female flap figures after Dürer’s 1504 Adam and Eve engraving. The second and third Visions display larger-scale images of Adam and Eve respectively, each standing on a skull with its own flaps. The medical doctor Johann Remmelin, who designed these flap prints as a student, coyly denied responsibility for the 1613 edition until the single-sheet prints appeared to be selling. Then he blessed the reuse of his “unripe fruit” as book illustrations.Perhaps uniquely for flap prints of this era, eighteenth-century restrikes from the plates for the 1619 second state are known. These show how tightly Kilian organized the interior flaps for printing. The etched organ flaps were cut out and pasted on the backs of the main engraved images, which were cut open, forming yet more flaps. Each constructed impression has survived in a different arrangement and bears signs of viewer interaction. The series elicited strong reactions due to its heady mix of allegorical iconography and Vesalian anatomy, made ever more potent by the removable organs and naked flesh. Indeed, an unidentified brown substance was applied to Eve’s genital area under two sets of modesty flaps—an unusual gesture of censorship, or perhaps prayer for offspring.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/51002/third-vision-from-mirrors-of-the-microcosm

This monumental undertaking, to which Sander gave the name People of the Twentieth Century, eventually grew to include more than 600 portraits (and thousands of poses) that formed a “physiognomical time exposure of German man,” in the photographer’s words.

For those requiring a wall-mounted image to focus their devotions, Sebald Beham’s magnificent, over-life-size Head of Christ woodcut after Dürer’s 1513 Sudarium engraving presents a dramatic close-up view of the imprint of the Holy Face. Its grand scale may be inspired by a fifteenth-century continuously repeating Sudarium wallpaper. Off-printing of the same image on the verso of this impression—a product of stacking and pressing multiple impressions in the workshop before they fully dried—is an unintentional reminder of printmaking’s symbolic function in the Sudarium story.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/23354/head-of-christ-crowned-with-thorns

The artist first exhibited Weimar with other vitrines named after German towns with intersecting railways.

This monumental undertaking, to which Sander gave the name People of the Twentieth Century, eventually grew to include more than 600 portraits (and thousands of poses) that formed a “physiognomical time exposure of German man,” in the photographer’s words. Remarkably consistent in their lighting and poses, and hung or reproduced in pairs in Sander’s lifetime, the portraits invite comparative analysis, suggesting limitless types rather than the quite limited typecasting espoused by Nazism, which Sander increasingly opposed.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/46997/high-school-student-gymnasiast

One impression was even pasted into a late-16th-century Mughal book known as the Jahangir or Berlin Album (now in the Berlin Staatsbibliothek), which is replete with calligraphy and miniatures.

At the time Michel made this print ( one of a series of four), Weimar was the focal point of extraordinary political, social, and cultural changes then transforming Germany. In 1919, after World War I, Weimar became the capital of a provisional federal state that ratified a new national constitution. Germany’s National Assembly, elected on January 19, first met in the Weimar National Theater on February 6, and on August 11 the Weimar Constitution was signed. Michel wrote, “After all, in 1919 Weimar is the center of things to come.” Therefore, one might read, in Mez, Michel’s depiction of the intricate workings of a clock and the date August 11 as his celebration of the birth of the Weimar Republic.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/69738/mez-mittel-europaische-zeit-weimar

This monumental undertaking, to which Sander gave the name People of the Twentieth Century, eventually grew to include more than 600 portraits (and thousands of poses) that formed a “physiognomical time exposure of German man,” in the photographer’s words. Remarkably consistent in their lighting and poses, and hung or reproduced in pairs in Sander’s lifetime, the portraits invite comparative analysis, suggesting limitless types rather than the quite limited typecasting espoused by Nazism, to which Sander grew increasingly opposed.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/212191/wife-of-the-cologne-painter-peter-abelen-gattin-des-kolner-malers-peter-abelen

The panoramic garden setting includes delights such as a group of musical enthusiasts perched on plush chairs and colonnaded ledges on the left; on the right is a fountain grotto with decorative streams of water into which the most boisterous men try to cajole their lovers. The unsure woman on the far right, her waist firmly grasped by a smooth-talking admirer, resists the necessary push into temptation from a determined, winged Eros.Rubens was deeply involved in producing prints after his paintings, of which the most illustrious were woodcuts created from about 1632 to 1636 by Christoffel Jegher. The most ambitious of these large woodcuts is the Garden of Love, a composition inspired by the painting of this subject (now at Waddeson Manor, Buckinghamshire), dated around 1630/31. Rather than an exact reproduction of the painting, the composition was redrawn with variations by Rubens on a separate sheet as a model for the woodcut artist to follow; it was then printed by Jeghers on two nearly equal-sized sheets that function as self-contained works. Belonging to the tradition of Medieval love gardens, the right half contains portraits of Rubens and his radiant young wife, Helena Fourment, who is echoed in almost all the female faces.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/122062/the-garden-of-love-right-half

S. engraving (1972.1), representations of the miraculous Einsiedeln Virgin statue became more iconic and increasingly triangular in appearance.

They adopted a consistent viewpoint that facilitated comparative analysis and, beginning around 1970, began calling their depersonalized collections of architectural forms “anonymous sculptures.” Grouped according to type or function, these typologies are presented in grids or sequences that prompt attention to shared motifs and structural principles. Although the Bechers were greatly influenced by Minimal and Conceptual Art, their approach also has historical roots. As Hilla Becher explained, “Our idea of showing the material has much more to do with the 19th century, with the encyclopedic approach used in botany or zoology, where plants of the same variety or animals of the same species are compared with one another on the individual pages of the lexicon.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/120872/blast-furnaces-heads-frontal-views

Untitled is from a series that the artist began in the late 1990s, in which he used basic computer technology to “draw” gesture. After printing these already-mediated images, enlarging and silkscreening them onto canvas, he painted over them—either erasing lines and shapes with white paint, extending marks with black brushstrokes, or adding spurts of spray paint. Exploring the dichotomy of the virtual and the handmade, these hybrid paintings raise questions about what constitutes freedom and control, addressing the intimate relationship between computer technology and human labor.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/184618/untitled

The emotional tenor of the scene is further enhanced by the lithograph’s pale green tint. Blechen used two stones to create this print, one with green ink for the background and the other bearing a drawing of the primary image. Though the landscape is gloomy, the shrine and its surroundings glow with the highlights produced as the artist scraped away passages on the tint stone.

Although the chair is actually stable, its compact, angular form appears to balance precariously on a thin metal stand, giving the impression that it will tip over if sat on and thus encouraging users to perch rather than recline. As Grcic attested, this is the point: “When I am sitting in front of someone or in a public space, I am more comfortable sitting on the edge of a chair and leaning into a conversation rather than lounging back in my seat.” Envisioned for use in public spaces such as lobbies or waiting rooms, the chair’s forked silhouette was determined by tracing a variety of seating positions into the lines of the design.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/201644/chaos-chair

Ironically, that very attention to “art for art’s sake” implied for Dix, through the fetishization of visual effects, a critique of the public’s unexamined embrace of the war.

The piece is unusual in that the piece is in fine condition and is unaltered and still retains its original borders. The very detailed design motif with architectural elements of the canopy and prie dieu are typical of the period. The centrally placed lily in a vase between the Virgin and the announcing angel represents purity; because of its depiction in many Annumciation scenes, the lily has become the flower of the Virgin and an attribute of the Archangel Gabriel. Mary appears to have been interrupted in prayer by the angel, carrying the scepter as herald of God. The dove at the upper right, is symbolic of the Holy Spirit. The panel is worked in a technique generally known as lacis, utilizing a ground of square netting which is subsequently embroidered with cloth and/or darning stitches. Lacis, or netting, is the oldest of the techniques of lace making, evolving from fishing nets and animal snares. Intended for ecclesiastical use, such as for alter frontals, funeral palls, hangings, and a variety of other liturical linens, were ornamented with sacred emblems or symbolic figures. This panel may have been a section from a much-larger alter frontal or hanging, or it may have been a separate picture.

While the handwritten text on the verso of the adjoining sheet in the booklet (once comprising nineteen metalcuts) does not mention the pretzel, it is handcolored in a warm, doughy yellow. A similar glow suffuses the head-on Sudarium at center, an unusually abstract inclusion for an image of the Passion.The fifteen metalcuts, or “dotted prints,” that form this Passion suite constitute one of the most complete block books in existence. It is possible that the series at one time included as many as nineteen images, each exquisitely hand-colored with the biblical text inscribed on the reverse.

It includes a set of salad servers made from lengths of bent wire, a collection of serving trays made from lasercut stainless steel, and a breadbasket perforated with elongated cuts that provide a decorative element. Recently, Grcic also added a set of cutlery, Accento, to the series. Its simple design reflects that used to create the other elements, though the oversized utensils also have a cartoonlike quality that sets them apart. Their unpretentious design makes them suitable for everyday use. Working with the same visual language, Grcic also added a set of salad servers, lasagna and cheese knives, and a risotto spoon to the Accento family of kitchen utensils.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/201516/accento-cutlery-set-of-36-pieces

He conceived Square Wastepaper Bin as a round base with square sides and a hole cut out on one side for a handle. The 2-Hands Laundry Basket, the next design in this family of quotidian products, is slightly oversized, yet lightweight and durable, with a seamless elegance that sets it apart from other such designs. The H20 Wastepaper Bin derived from Grcic’s desire to make subtle adjustments to the commonplace object by adding a lid and rim at the top and bottom of the piece. For the Tip Wastepaper Bin, Grcic enlarged the hinge mechanism that opens and closes the lid to prevent it from breaking with use. Through a disciplined process of research and design development, Grcic was thus able to introduce a range of products that respond to basic human needs.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/200805/h2o-waste-paper-bin

He conceived Square Wastepaper Bin as a round base with square sides and a hole cut out on one side for a handle. The 2-Hands Laundry Basket, the next design in this family of quotidian products, is slightly oversized, yet lightweight and durable, with a seamless elegance that sets it apart from other such designs. The H20 Wastepaper Bin derived from Grcic’s desire to make subtle adjustments to the commonplace object by adding a lid and rim at the top and bottom of the piece. For the Tip Wastepaper Bin, Grcic enlarged the hinge mechanism that opens and closes the lid to prevent it from breaking with use. Through a disciplined process of research and design development, Grcic was thus able to introduce a range of products that respond to basic human needs.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/200788/2-hands-laundry-basket

This monumental undertaking, to which Sander gave the name People of the Twentieth Century, eventually grew to include more than 600 portraits (and thousands of poses) that formed a “physiognomical time exposure of German man,” in the photographer’s words. Remarkably consistent in their lighting and poses, and hung or reproduced in pairs in Sander’s lifetime, the portraits invite comparative analysis, suggesting limitless types rather than the quite limited typecasting espoused by Nazism, which Sander increasingly opposed.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/212190/attorney-and-delegate-of-the-democratic-party-johannes-scheerer-der-prokurist-und-abgeordnete-der-demokratischen-partei-johannes-scheerer

In this metalcut series on the life of Christ, the shape of the bread—the traditional Bretzel, or pretzel—betrays that the prints were made in Bavaria. While the handwritten text on the verso of the adjoining sheet in the booklet (once comprising nineteen metalcuts) does not mention the pretzel, it is handcolored in a warm, doughy yellow. A similar glow suffuses the head-on Sudarium at center, an unusually abstract inclusion for an image of the Passion.The fifteen metalcuts, or “dotted prints,” that form this Passion suite constitute one of the most complete block books in existence. It is possible that the series at one time included as many as nineteen images, each exquisitely hand-colored with the biblical text inscribed on the reverse. The stars, shells, and other repeating patterns were produced by hammering metal punches, such as those used by goldsmiths and armorers, into the soft metal plates.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/155499/christ-in-the-garden-of-gethsemane

His paintings were known for their beautiful and recognizable vegetation, which also permeates his etchings. In The Large Italian Landscape, two wanderers on horseback enjoy an afternoon outing, framed by a lush forest and meandering stream.

The quirky design consists of a crossbar on which one can sit, perch, or lean, with a low backrest for support. It is meant for activities that require one to move and take up a variety of positions during the workday, rather than for long stints in front of the computer. Grcic envisioned the 360° Chair being used in the studios of designers and architects, as well as in salons orbarbershops. Its five-star metal base with casters indicates its function, and a footrest at the base is marked like a compass, illustrating the chair’s ability to spin 360 degrees, as its name suggests. The 360° family of furniture also includes a high stool, a table, and a mobile storage unit.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/201569/360%C2%BA-stool

The first all plastic cantilevered chair to be designed since Verner Panton’s 1960s version, it was born out of a collaboration with the German chemical company BASF, which was looking for a way to illustrate the potential of the high-tech plastic Ultradur® High Speed beyond its use in engines and circuit boards. Italian furniture manufacturer Plank joined forces with BASF to produce and distribute the Myto Chair. The distinctive profile of the chair and the integrated latticework of the surface of the seat and backrest were made possible by the behavioral properties of the plastic, which also allowed for the strong, comfortable, light, and stackable nature of the piece.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/201463/myto-cantilever-chair

The first all plastic cantilevered chair to be designed since Verner Panton’s 1960s version, it was born out of a collaboration with the German chemical company BASF, which was looking for a way to illustrate the potential of the high-tech plastic Ultradur® High Speed beyond its use in engines and circuit boards. Italian furniture manufacturer Plank joined forces with BASF to produce and distribute the Myto Chair. The distinctive profile of the chair and the integrated latticework of the surface of the seat and backrest were made possible by the behavioral properties of the plastic, which also allowed for the strong, comfortable, light, and stackable nature of the piece.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/201585/myto-cantilever-chair

In this metalcut series on the life of Christ, the shape of the bread—the traditional Bretzel, or pretzel—betrays that the prints were made in Bavaria. While the handwritten text on the verso of the adjoining sheet in the booklet (once comprising nineteen metalcuts) does not mention the pretzel, it is handcolored in a warm, doughy yellow. A similar glow suffuses the head-on Sudarium at center, an unusually abstract inclusion for an image of the Passion.The fifteen metalcuts, or “dotted prints,” that form this Passion suite constitute one of the most complete block books in existence. It is possible that the series at one time included as many as nineteen images, each exquisitely hand-colored with the biblical text inscribed on the reverse. The stars, shells, and other repeating patterns were produced by hammering metal punches, such as those used by goldsmiths and armorers, into the soft metal plates.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/155507/the-pieta

The border of Fruits, with its softly rendered rubbings from wood grain, show the classic signs of frottage, while the central still life, turned on its axis and appearing to float in space, has a compositional clarity that is difficult to achieve with this method.Ernst used frottage to expand the possibilities of art by surrendering some control when creating a design.

Only then would details be burnished out of the dark field. While Gäfgen made some mezzotints on a pristine white ground, these isolated, hyperrealistic objects are better served by a stark black background.

He conceived Square Wastepaper Bin as a round base with square sides and a hole cut out on one side for a handle. The 2-Hands Laundry Basket, the next design in this family of quotidian products, is slightly oversized, yet lightweight and durable, with a seamless elegance that sets it apart from other such designs. The H20 Wastepaper Bin derived from Grcic’s desire to make subtle adjustments to the commonplace object by adding a lid and rim at the top and bottom of the piece. For the Tip Wastepaper Bin, Grcic enlarged the hinge mechanism that opens and closes the lid to prevent it from breaking with use. Through a disciplined process of research and design development, Grcic was thus able to introduce a range of products that respond to basic human needs.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/200806/h2o-waste-paper-bin

The first all plastic cantilevered chair to be designed since Verner Panton’s 1960s version, it was born out of a collaboration with the German chemical company BASF, which was looking for a way to illustrate the potential of the high-tech plastic Ultradur® High Speed beyond its use in engines and circuit boards. Italian furniture manufacturer Plank joined forces with BASF to produce and distribute the Myto Chair. The distinctive profile of the chair and the integrated latticework of the surface of the seat and backrest were made possible by the behavioral properties of the plastic, which also allowed for the strong, comfortable, light, and stackable nature of the piece.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/201465/myto-cantilever-chair

Among Münter’s early depictions of this subject, this particular composition features saturated colors and boldly styled contour lines typical of this pivotal moment in Münter’s early development. “After a short period of agony,” she described, “I made a big leap [in Murnau], from copying nature—more or less impressionistically—to feeling its content, to abstracting, to presenting a distillation.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/261662/the-blue-lake-der-blaue-see

Schematically depicting the operation of a large-format camera, the picture shows how the photographic subject at far left is transformed into a black-and-white print at the bottom center of the composition.Seiwert was a founding member of the Cologne Progressives, a group of artists who turned away from the total abstraction practiced by their contemporaries. Instead, they developed an easily legible and quasi-abstract style that could be understood by all members of society, regardless of their prior experience with art. Using unsentimental imagery to advance progressive social themes, they brought to painting the democratic spirit of both photography and public murals.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/261311/mural-for-a-photographer-wandbild-fur-einen-fotografen

Jürgen Klauke’s important early performance piece explores the fluidity of gender and sexuality, and his choice of materials extends this subversion of expectations. Playing with costume, makeup, and pose, Klauke challenges the signs that traditionally define gender identity. Similarly, the pictures appear to be black-and-white photographs but were in fact printed on color paper. Over time, the dyes that form the image might degrade, altering the work’s current gray tonality and creating unwanted casts of color. To avoid this, conservators keep Klauke’s prints in cold storage, with color photographs.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/243525/physiognomien-2

Umbach’s magnificent trees and vistas were particularly influenced by 16th-century German landscapes by the Danube School and 17th-century works by the Dutch painter and printmaker Jacob van Ruisdael.

In these selections from a larger set of nineteen images, Hajek-Halke manipulates tabletop setups of ordinary objects like ball bearings, broken glass, and figurines to produce the impression of Expressionist landscapes or ships at sea. Including himself in the photographs—and revealing the objects as they lie “at rest” on ordinary bookshelves—he tips his hand, turning the craft behind the illusion into his subject. Although the series was never published, an inscription on the reverse of the first photograph suggests Hajek-Halke’s pleasure in the work. It translates to “Successful playing around with fantasy and camera: Sunset on the Moor.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/236341/the-camera-conquers-unknown-photographic-territory-die-kamera-erobert-fotografisches-neuland

Including himself in the photographs—and revealing the objects as they lie “at rest” on ordinary bookshelves—he tips his hand, turning the craft behind the illusion into his subject.

Hunting scenes, including both animals and aristocratic figures, were one of his specialties. This drawing, Spring, and its pendant Winter, come from a series depicting hunters across the four seasons. The hunter portrayed here holds a heron and a rifle as he contentedly gazes at his bounty of deer, rabbits, and other birds.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/222578/the-industrious-hunter-in-spring

Although the series was never published, an inscription on the reverse of the first photograph suggests Hajek-Halke’s pleasure in the work.

The Chicago impression is tattered around the edges, has sustained fading and loss of printed pigment throughout, and exhibits several areas of worm activity.

Playing with costume, makeup, and pose, Klauke challenges the signs that traditionally define gender identity. Similarly, the pictures appear to be black-and-white photographs but were in fact printed on color paper. Over time, the dyes that form the image might degrade, altering the work’s current gray tonality and creating unwanted casts of color. To avoid this, conservators keep Klauke’s prints in cold storage, with color photographs.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/243527/physiognomien-3

This monumental undertaking, to which Sander gave the name People of the Twentieth Century, eventually grew to include more than 600 portraits (and thousands of poses) that formed a “physiognomical time exposure of German man,” in the photographer’s words. Remarkably consistent in their lighting and poses, and hung or reproduced in pairs in Sander’s lifetime, the portraits invite comparative analysis, suggesting limitless types rather than the quite limited typecasting espoused by Nazism, which Sander increasingly opposed.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/50801/fotographenmeister-koln

In this metalcut series on the life of Christ, the shape of the bread—the traditional Bretzel, or pretzel—betrays that the prints were made in Bavaria. While the handwritten text on the verso of the adjoining sheet in the booklet (once comprising nineteen metalcuts) does not mention the pretzel, it is handcolored in a warm, doughy yellow. A similar glow suffuses the head-on Sudarium at center, an unusually abstract inclusion for an image of the Passion.The fifteen metalcuts, or “dotted prints,” that form this Passion suite constitute one of the most complete block books in existence. It is possible that the series at one time included as many as nineteen images, each exquisitely hand-colored with the biblical text inscribed on the reverse. The stars, shells, and other repeating patterns were produced by hammering metal punches, such as those used by goldsmiths and armorers, into the soft metal plates.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/155508/the-deposition

ger_4635,Konstantin Grcic (Designer),Die-cast aluminum and concrete,chair_ONE,"Launched in 2004, chair_ONE was an important project for German designer Konsantin Grcic. It has since come to define his fearless embrace of complex processes. Unlike anything he had designed before, this project marked a critical juncture for him. Approached with the idea of utilizing die-cast aluminum, Grcic seized the opportunity to try something new. What resulted was a design that recalls the wire rod chairs that such designers as Harry Bertoia and Charles and Ray Eames produced in the 1950s and 1960s, but which, instead of wire, exploits the essential principles of die-casting aluminum to create a chair with unique qualities.The requirement that liquid metal be injected into a mould inspired the basketlike structure of the seat, which gives the chair its primary visual language. This form was further developed, three-dimensionally, by the practical needs of the chair to provide support. Playing with a web of narrow tubes, pulling them up to create a backrest and then mimicking this on the sides by folding up the shorter edges of the seat, Grcic was able to sculpt a form that cradles the body and also provides the internal strength for the chair. Subtle, but crucial, adjustments to the design were introduced over a period of two years, during which the chair was continuously tested through digital means to ensure that the network of branching elements achieved its optimal visual and structural form. As in much of his work, Grcic’s indomitable process was driven as much by logic as an eye to aesthetics, and he relied on an intense process of design development using skillfully made physical models, digital renderings, and computer simulations as guides.The resolute silhouette of chair_ONE has proven incredibly tangible, and it quickly yielded a family of designs that have grown directly out of this initial model. These include an outdoor version, complete with a cone-shaped concrete base so that it can’t easily be removed, and a bench made from three chairs linked underneath by a central crossbar.

Like his father, he initially made his living as a theater scenery painter for the Munich court, and he was even named court painter for architectural scenery by age 21. Leaving Munich to make topographical paintings of sites throughout the country, he was also an adherent of lithography, a relatively new printmaking technique invented in Munich in 1798.Quaglio traveled throughout Central Europe, recording images of churches and castles as prints. Amidst the ruins in this scene are the tombstones of Saint Genevieve and her husband, Siegfried, Count Palatine of the Rhine. Genevieve was wrongly accused of adultery and forced to live in a forest for several years. She survived through her faith until her husband happened across her while hunting. After she convinced Siegfried of her innocence, she returned to Andernach. She had the Church of Our Lady built in the forest where she had stayed in order to show her gratitude to God for keeping her safe.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/158743/ruin-of-the-church-of-our-lady-with-the-tombstones-of-genevieve-and-the-count-palatine-siegfried-in-the-mosel-valley-near-andernach-from-collection-of-memorable-medieval-buildings-in-germany

The collection seen in this gallery benefits from the artist’s extensive travels throughout Germany, his adopted home, and documents impressive structures surviving from the 16th century and earlier.
