itl_1,Bartolomeo Manfredi,Oil on canvas,Cupid Chastised,"Following the example of the revolutionary early seventeenth-century artist Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio, Bartolomeo Manfredi chose to depict ordinary individuals in his scenes from the Bible and Greek and Roman mythology. Caravaggio had demonstrated to Manfredi and an entire generation of European artists that such lofty themes could be transformed into events experienced by ordinary people. Employing dramatic lighting and locating the action directly before the viewer, these artists were able to endow their narratives with great immediacy and power.Cupid Chastised depicts a moment of high drama: Mars, the god of war, beats Cupid for having caused his affair with Venus, the goddess of love, which exposed him to the derision and outrage of the other gods. Venus implores him in vain to desist. Surrounded by darkness, the three figures are boldly illuminated from the left, intensifying the dynamism and impact of the composition. The sheer physicality of the figures — the crouching Venus, whose broadly realized face strays from the classical ideal; the powerful Mars, whose musculature and brilliant red drapery seem to pulsate with fury; and Cupid, whose naked flesh and recumbent position render him particularly vulnerable—conveys the violent discord of the scene. On one level a tale of domestic disturbance, the story also symbolizes the eternal conflict between love and war.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/59847/cupid-chastised
itl_2,Giorgio de Chirico,Oil on canvas,The Philosopher’s Conquest,"The work of Giorgio de Chirico represents an unexpected form of classicism in early avant-garde painting. This canvas, one of six in a series, combines a Mediterranean cityscape with still-life objects. Familiar elements appear in many of de Chirico’s paintings like pieces of a mysterious puzzle: a classical arcade, oddly oversize artichokes, a cannon and cannonballs, a clock, an industrial brick chimney, a monumental tower, a running train, and a square-rigged sailing ship. Here the stage set for this extraordinary juxtaposition of objects is an Italian piazza, virtually deserted except for the menacing shadowy figures outside the edge of the scene.De Chirico represented objects with a matter-of-fact, though intentionally crude, precision. He painted his scenes flatly, in bright colors, and illuminated them with a cold white light. Rendered in this clear style, works like The Philosopher’s Conquest seem rife with meaning, though they remain resolutely enigmatic. Indeed, by juxtaposing incongruous objects, the artist sought to produce a metaphysical quality, what he called “art that in certain aspects resembles … the restlessness of myth.” De Chirico’s works would profoundly affect the Surrealists, who in the 1920s and 1930s attempted to portray dreams and images of the subconscious in their work.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/30839/the-philosopher-s-conquest
itl_3,Francesco Mochi,"Marble, on variegated black marble socle",Bust of a Youth (Saint John the Baptist?),"One of the most individual sculptors of his age, Francesco Mochi possessed an astoun- ding technical prowess. Although his output was relatively small, Mochi was one of the most original artists to emerge in seventeenth-century Italy. His art is distinguished by energetic lines, dramatic movement, and subtle psychology. Here a taut precision characterizes the youth’s garment, and a carefully composed rhythm governs Mochi’s virtuoso treatment of the corkscrew curls. In contrast to the greater precision of the hair and drapery, the wistful expression of the youth, with his slightly parted lips, endows the sculpture with life. This work may have been conceived as a portrait, but it is more likely a biblical or mythological subject. The almost transcendent expression suggests that the sculpture may represent a religious figure, such as the youthful Saint John the Baptist. Its small scale suggests that the work was intended as an object for private contemplation.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/73413/bust-of-a-youth-saint-john-the-baptist
itl_4,Antonio da Correggio,Oil on panel,Virgin and Child with the Young Saint John the Baptist,"Correggio spent most of his brief career in the northern Italian city of Parma. Removed from the great centers of Renaissance art, he was able to create a remarkably innovative body of work. This intimate devotional panel is a product of the artist’s youth. Here Correggio revealed his own evolving style while assimilating lessons from other masters. The panel’s pyramidal grouping of figures reﬂects the High Renaissance manner of Raphael, while their soft outlines and the Virgin’s enigmatic smile recall Leonardo da Vinci. The evocative use of the distant landscape demonstrates the young artist’s awareness of Northern European precedents. The gentle sensuousness of the figures and the tenderness they show one another through glance are unique to Correggio. The artist used light, shadow, and color to bathe the panel in a gentle glow; skin and fabrics appear to take on a velvety texture. The expressive, idyllic quality of this painting presages the radiant ceiling frescoes of Correggio’s maturity, especially those in Parma’s Cathedral.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/23972/virgin-and-child-with-the-young-saint-john-the-baptist
itl_5,Fra Bartolommeo,Oil on panel,The Nativity,"The young Baccio della Porta came under the spell of the charismatic Dominican friar Girolamo Savonarola, joining his monastic order as Fra (Friar) Bartolommeo in 1500 and forsaking his painting career for several years. Returning to painting in 1504, he looked to the most lyrical and harmonious recent works of Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, and Michelangelo to form his own style, which was characterized by a new, quiet spirituality. The palette of saturated blue, red, and green announces the Holy Family, while the muted tones of the angels’ garments establish an otherworldly presence. Here he treated the Nativity in a traditional, though especially intimate, manner. The Virgin kneels humbly as she gazes at the Christ Child, while Joseph assumes a pose of restrained wonderment, as if suddenly aware of the infant’s divine nature. The family shelters in a rustic stall erected within the ruins of an edifice understood to be the palace of David at Bethlehem. This juxtaposition of architecture symbolizes Christ’s establishment of his new church on the Old Testament order of the Jews. Reinforcing this device is a young tree springing from a remnant of ancient stones directly above the infant.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/184371/the-nativity
itl_6,Giambattista Tiepolo,Oil on canvas,Armida Encounters the Sleeping Rinaldo,"Giovanni Battista Tiepolo’s monumental ceiling and wall decorations epitomize the brilliant exuberance of the late Baroque style. Tiepolo enjoyed an international career and was called upon to use his mastery of light, color, and illusion to transform palaces and monasteries in his native Venice and elsewhere in Italy, as well as in Germany and Spain. This painting and three others at the Art Institute, together with smaller decorative panels and a ceiling painting, once graced the cabinet of mirrors, a richly decorated room in the Venetian palace of the powerful Cornaro family. The suite illustrates Torquato Tasso’s popular sixteenth-century epic romance Jerusalem Delivered, which is set in the eleventh century, during the First Crusade, when Western knights sought to take Jerusalem from the Muslims. The canvas captures the moment of Rinaldo’s seduction: the beautiful sorceress Armida has just arrived to divert the sleeping hero from his crusade. Accompanied by her attendant nymph and a cupid figure, she appears like a beautiful mirage, enthroned on a billowing cloud, her drapery and shawl wafting gently behind her. Altough Tasso’s story symbolizes the conﬂict between love and duty, Tiepolo’s depiction of a magical, bucolic world—enhanced by effervescent colors, luminous atmosphere, and dense, creamy paint—seems to evoke only love’s enchantment.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16488/armida-encounters-the-sleeping-rinaldo
itl_7,Giovanni di Paolo,Tempera on panel,The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist,"This is one of six paintings illustrating scenes from the life of Saint John the Baptist, a prophet considered a forerunner of Jesus. They were originally part of a group of 12 that possibly formed the doors of a reliquary shrine to the saint. The first painting depicts John twice, leaving civilization—marked by ornate buildings and manicured agricultural fields—and entering the wilderness to become a hermit. In the next scene, John wears a hair shirt, symbolizing his ascetic life in the wilderness, as he announces that Jesus, at his right, is the savior prophesied as the agnus dei, the Lamb of God.The following three panels depict John the Baptist’s imprisonment and execution at the hands of Herod, ruler of Galilee. According to one version of the story, Herod—seen in blue at the head of the table in the fourth panel from the left—was so taken by his stepdaughter Salome’s dancing that he reluctantly obliged when she requested John’s beheading (visualized gruesomely in the fifth panel). Giovanni di Paolo related the Baptist’s complex biography with expressive figures represented multiple times to indicate their movement through highly imaginative and stylized settings.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16169/the-beheading-of-saint-john-the-baptist
itl_8,Amedeo Modigliani,Oil on canvas,Jacques and Berthe Lipchitz,"After receiving his artistic training in Italy, the sculptor and painter Amedeo Modigliani moved to Paris in 1906. Three years later, he helped pioneer a general migration of artists to the neighborhood of Montparnasse, which remained the center of avant-gard activity in the city until World War II. Scores of artists lived there, and many of them shared a Jewish heritage—including Modigliani and his friend the Lithuanian-born sculptor Jacques Lipchitz.Lipchitz commissioned Modigliani to paint this portrait on the occasion of his marriage to the Russian poet Berthe Kitrosser, as a way of helping his troubled friend financially. The double portrait is one of only three in the artist’s oeuvre and, according to Lipchitz, took two days to paint. Modigliani made about twenty drawings on the first day; the next day, he declared the picture finished. At the modest price of what Lipchitz remembered as “ten francs per sitting and a little alcohol,” however, he persuaded Modigliani to work on the portrait for another two weeks in an effort to provide more financial assistance to his friend. Despite Modigliani’s exceptional talent, his work found a market only after his death in 1920, which was hastened by tuberculosis and his legendary bohemian lifestyle.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/27987/jacques-and-berthe-lipchitz
itl_9,Guido Reni,Oil on canvas,Salome with the Head of Saint John the Baptist,"This painting depicts Salome as she receives the head of John the Baptist on a platter, the gruesome reward she chose for having pleased her stepfather, Herod, by performing a seductive dance. This episode from the New Testament had long been popular in Italian art, thanks to its combination of religiosity, violence, and eroticism. The most famous and successful Italian painter of his day, Guido Reni worked in Rome and then in Bologna, where his highly refined style and intensely spiritual subjects dominated. Despite its horrific subject matter, this unfinished work displays the graceful movement, delicate colors, and transparent paint application of Reni’s late style.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/11434/salome-with-the-head-of-saint-john-the-baptist
itl_10,Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione,Monotype in black ink on ivory laid paper,The Creation of Adam,"Considered one of the most original and innovative Italian artists of the Baroque period, Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione literally separated light from darkness, creating form out of chaos in this work, his earliest known monotype. In a perfect match of medium and message, Castiglione, the Genoese artist credited with inventing the technique, used this new method to portray the central act of Genesis: the creation of man. He produced this electrifying image by subtracting the design from the inked surface of a copperplate with a blunt instrument, such as a stick or paintbrush handle, and then printing directly on a sheet of paper. Broad, angular strokes of white depict God emerging from a cloud, while thin, fluid lines extract the languid body of Adam from velvety blackness. Castiglione’s monotypes employ both this dark-ground technique, which naturally lends itself to dramatic and mysterious imagery, and the light-ground manner, in which the design is drawn in ink directly on a clean plate. Both processes yield only one fine impression. It was not until the nineteenth century that such versatile artists as Edgar Degas explored the monotype’s full potential.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/105073/the-creation-of-adam
itl_11,Antonio Canova,Marble,Bust of Paris,"The enormously popular Neoclassical sculptor Antonio Canova frequently made replicas or variants of his major works to satisfy the demand for his art. While executing a commission from Empress Josephine of France for a full-length statue of Paris (State Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg), Canova carved this bust for his friend Antoine Quatremère de Quincy, a French Neoclassical theorist and critic who greatly inﬂuenced the sculptor’s artistic ideals. It depicts the moment in Greek mythology when the shepherd Paris, called upon by Zeus to judge who was the most beautiful among Hera, Athena, and Aphrodite, turns to gaze at the three goddesses. Canova exploited the subject to create an ideal head, balancing the geometry of pure forms with the sensuousness of Paris’s expression. Upon receipt of the gift, Quatremère stated: “There is in [the bust] a mixture of the heroic and the voluptuous, the noble and the amorous. I do not believe that in any other work you have ever combined such life, softness, and chaste purity.” Documents indicate that Canova made four full-length marble statues and at least seven busts of Paris, a clear indication of the sculpture’s popularity.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/102591/bust-of-paris
itl_12,Alessandro Vittoria,Bronze,The Annunciation,"Alessandro Vittoria translated into bronze the flickering light of Venetian Renaissance paintings. Working in wax (from which the finished bronze was then cast), he manipulated this relief’s form and edges to catch the light. The result is a highly animated surface in which everything—figures, drapery, clouds, and sky—seems to move with excitement, heightening the drama between the startled Virgin Mary and the archangel Gabriel, who has descended from heaven to announce that Mary will bear the son of God. Fully sculpted in the round, the archangel’s arm points to the smallest feature in the scene: a dove, representing the Holy Spirit of the Christian Trinity.This sculpture was commissioned by Hans Fugger, a member of a prominent Augsburg banking family, to decorate an altarpiece for the chapel of his family’s castle in Kirchheim in the Swabia region of Germany.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/44741/the-annunciation

itl_14,Lorenzo Monaco,Tempera on panel,Processional Cross with Saint Mary Magdalene and a Blessed Hermit,"Representative of the early work of Lorenzo Monaco, a Camaldolese monk and leading Florentine painter of the end of the fourteenth century and the beginning of the fifteenth century, the delicate colors and simplified forms of this Crucifixion are exceptionally well preserved. The medallion above the crucified Christ contains an image of Christ in Glory, holding a palm in each hand to symbolize his victory over death. Below, the crowned figure of King David holds an inscribed scroll. More often in Crucifixion scenes of this period, a pelican appears at the top of the cross and the skull of Adam lies at the foot. A penitential theme is suggested by the figures kneeling under the Cross: on the right is a haloed Magdalen in a red robe; on the left, a man with the incised rays of a beatus, or blessed one, emanating from his head wears the torn brown cloak of a hermit. He was probably meant to represent a specific hermit within the Camaldolese order. The panel has a hole drilled at the base, allowing it to be mounted on a pole and used as a processional cross, likely in the monastic Camaldolese community of Santa Maria degli Angeli, where Lorenzo lived and worked.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16231/processional-cross-with-saint-mary-magdalene-and-a-blessed-hermit
itl_15,Giovanni Battista Piazzetta,Oil on canvas,Pastoral Scene,"One of Venice’s leading painters, Giovanni Battista Piazzetta transformed the gritty realism and dramatic light effects of earlier Baroque painting into his own poetic style. This is one of two paintings of life-size, rustic ﬁgures that Piazetta made for his patron, Field Marshall Johann Matthias von der Schulenberg. Their meaning remains mysterious. The half-naked boy holding a basket of grapes has been interpreted as the infant Bacchus, the god of wine, although Piazzetta made no reference in his description of the work to a symbolic meaning. The artist was probably responding to his patron’s taste for pastoral scenes, a genre that appealed to middle- and upper-class city dwellers for its idealized views of rural life.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/23333/pastoral-scene
itl_16,Francesco Durantino,Tin-glazed earthenware (maiolica),Wine Cistern,"Elaborately fashioned platters, vessels, and containers, often with decorative embellishments that indicated their specialized function or their owner’s social status, were displayed on the banquet tables of Renaissance Italy. Cisterns such as this were filled with cold water and used to cool wine bottles at feasts. Skillfully decorated by the Italian ceramic painter Francesco Durantino, this work typifies the Renaissance interest in both Christian imagery and scenes from pagan antiquity. It is covered with depictions of two famous battle scenes, one on land and one at sea. Although the exterior, adapted from frescoes by Raphael’s followers, represents a land battle culminating in the conversion of the Roman emperor Constantine I to Christianity, the cistern’s interior depicts a legendary naval disaster: the sinking of the Trojan hero Aeneas’s ships by the jealous goddess Hera. At the cistern’s center, the ships disappear beneath the waves, a playful conceit that was no doubt even more effective when the cistern was filled with water. The generously sized vessel displays all the characteristics that made maiolica, a tin-glazed earthenware, popular: brilliant colors, lively painting, and riveting narratives mixed with fanciful design. The term maiolica probably comes from Majorca, the port through which pottery from Moorish Spain was first exported to Italy.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/25853/wine-cistern
itl_17,Francesco Guardi,Oil on canvas,The Garden of Palazzo Contarini dal Zaffo,"A member of a family of painters in Venice, Francesco Guardi is renowned for his lively views of the most recognizable monuments of this picturesque city and for his engaging architectural fantasies, or capricci. Wealthy travelers making the grand tour of Europe—considered an essential part of an education for upper-class men—provided an important market for such views. In this case, however, the patron was not a foreigner passing through Venice, but John Strange, who lived in the city on the lagoon as the British resident, or representative.This view of the garden of a private house in Venice was highly unusual for Guardi. On the right is the rear facade of the Palazzo Contarini dal Zaffo; the front faces the Grand Canal. The artist’s main subject here is the palace’s formal garden, a luxury in Venice’s crowded urban environment. Elegant couples stroll through the garden’s geometric parterres. Guardi’s attention to the play of light further animates the scene—a shadow cast by an unseen building in the foreground divides the composition and contrasts with the bright light reflected off the facade of the residence and the distant, shimmering lagoon on the left.These observations of light and place probably reflect the aesthetic interests of Strange, who commissioned the painting from Guardi as one of a set of four remarkably original views. Two of the four paintings show Strange’s own villa on the mainland. What connection Strange may have had to the Palazzo Contarini dal Zaffo is unclear.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/111610/the-garden-of-palazzo-contarini-dal-zaffo
itl_18,Salvator Rosa,Etching with drypoint in black on ivory laid paper,The Fall of the Giants,"Just as the Giants—Gaia’s offspring—attempt to storm the throne of the Olympian gods, Jupiter brings them crashing down with a thunderbolt. He can be seen at the top in the clouds. Salvator Rosa executed this colossal composition at the pinnacle of his etching career, and dedicated it to the Florentine poet Horatio Quaranta. Rosa’s pessimistic admonition appears at the bottom of the sheet: “They are raised up high that they may be hurled down in more terrible ruin.”Multitalented with boundless energy, Rosa was also a poet, actor, musician, and painter. He made this print to promote his ideas for a painting of the same subject in hopes that a patron would sponsor its execution.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16/the-fall-of-the-giants
itl_19,,Steel with gilding,Shaffron,"Chivalry—with its connotation of the knightly ideal—was intimately connected with the horse (cheval in French). A knight took care to protect his mount, on which he was dependent for the mobility and speed required in both attack and retreat. In Roman times, some heavy cavalry used armor made of iron or bronze scales to protect their horses. From the twelth century on, knights covered their steeds in bands of iron mail (a network of interlocking rings). By the fifteenth century, full-plate armors were not uncommon. This shaffron, or headpiece, is etched in gilt bands with decoration on a finely dotted ground. Riveted between the eyes is an elongated conical spike, perhaps inspired by the horn of the mythical unicorn. A manifestation of great power and wealth, the shaffron has been valued for centuries as an object of beauty, not just as a tool of warfare and sport.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/199854/shaffron

The elegance of the twisting, attenuated figures reflects the influence of Biscaino’s teacher, Valerio Gastello, but it also recalls the Mannerist etching style of Parmigianino.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/89/rest-on-the-flight-into-egypt
itl_26,Luigi Rossini,Etching on off-white wove paper,The Arch of Septimus Severus,"Luigi Rossini trained as an architect in Bologna before moving to Rome in 1813, where he had more success as an artist. Following in the footsteps of Giovanni Battista Piranesi, Rossini began a series of etchings of Rome’s constructed marvels. His extensive knowledge of structural design proved valuable for his accurate, detailed portrayals of sites such as the antique arch of Septimus Severus. Whereas Piranesi tended to exaggerate his scenes, Rossini remained grounded in his realistic representations. Because Rossini’s depictions are so precise, his prints serve as important records of Rome’s architectural heritage.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/23/the-arch-of-septimus-severus

These icons of military prowess are surrounded by bucking horses, falling soldiers, and spears. It is ironic that Giovanni Jacopo Caraglio chose to depict the Romans as skilled cavalrymen, since the cavalry was the weakest part of the Roman army until the late Imperial Period (A.D. 3rd/4th century). The inscription at the bottom of the engraving attributes the design for this print to Raphael; it may preserve a rejected idea for his Battle for the Milvian Bridge in the Sala di Costantino in the Vatican, Rome.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/30/the-battle-around-the-shield-and-lance

itl_33,Leafless Group,"terracotta, black-figure",Mastoid (Drinking Cup),"This cup was shaped to fit easily in the drinkers hand, and was likely used as part of the Greek symposium. Much like modern academic symposiums, in which people discuss a topic of common interest, debunking old theories and putting forth new hypotheses; the men of ancient Athens regularly got together in private homes to exchange ideas. Afterward the participants might continue the conversation, discussing their impressions in greater detail or simply socializing over a drink. As the evening progressed, participants engaged in other pleasures, including games, performances, and sex. Wine played a major role in fueling these evenings, and as such the myriad vessels used in the symposium often paid homage to drink.Here, the god of wine Dionysos rides astride a donkey. Before and behind him satyrs - the gods half man half goat companions - are visually aroused by the scene; while a Maenad - their female counterpart - leads the procession while strumming a lyre. The background of this scene is decorated with winding vines, enforcing the themes of wine, revelry and music.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/155/mastoid-drinking-cup
itl_34,Cristofano Robetta,Engraving on paper,Allegory of Envy,"Flanked by younger couples entwined in erotic poses, an unaccompanied older woman appears to scowl. It is unclear whether the central figure, traditionally identified with envy, is the one experiencing the feeling or merely a visual symbol of it. Secular allegorical subjects were popular with Renaissance printmakers, especially in Italy.

itl_42,Francesco Buoneri,Oil on canvas,The Resurrection,"Francesco Buoneri was one of the closest followers of Caravaggio, the groundbreaking and influential painter of the Italian Baroque period. Buoneri may have assisted and modeled for Caravaggio during the elder painter’s last years in Rome, a personal connection suggested by his contemporary nickname, Cecco (a diminutive of Francesco) del Carravaggio. The Resurrection exaggerates the bold contrast of light and dark and the realistic treatment of sacred figures that were hallmarks of Caravaggio’s revolutionary style.The only documented painting by Buoneri, this work was commissioned in 1619 by the Tuscan ambassador to Rome, Piero Guicciardini, for his family’s chapel in Florence. For reasons lost to history, the painting was rejected, a not uncommon event in Rome’s rapidly evolving art scene. It was eventually sold to another important collector, Cardinal Scipione Borghese.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/19336/the-resurrection

itl_51,Sandro Botticelli,Tempera on panel,Virgin and Child with an Angel,"In this humanizing yet idealized depiction of the Virgin Mary embracing the baby Jesus, Sandro Botticelli conveys the sacred beauty of maternal love. Mary, expression soft and skin luminous, nuzzles her son’s chubby cheek as he grasps the nape of her neck. An angel, smaller in scale, looks on adoringly. Celebrated in his own time, Botticelli developed a distinctly sentimental and tactile style of painting for both religious and secular subjects.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/80530/virgin-and-child-with-an-angel

Boldrini frequently worked from drawings by Titian. This particularly comedic composition suggests that the painter was lampooning the smaller-scale copies based on the Laöcoon that Titian could have seen in Venice. Alternately, the print could reference the contemporary debate over the anatomical similarities between humans and apes, in which Andreas Vesalius’s new research (based on his dissection of human cadavers) clashed with the long-accepted writings of the ancient Greek physician Galen.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/20729/laocoon

Lucretia was hailed as a hero for subsequently committing suicide in an attempt to avoid any perceived dishonor to her family. With his characteristic expressive distortions of anatomy and space and vibrant treatment of light, Tintoretto depicted one of the most violent moments of the story. As Tarquin and Lucretia struggle, a pillow flies through the air, her pearl necklace breaks apart, and the fabric and carved post of the bed’s canopy collapses around them.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/64920/tarquin-and-lucretia
itl_56,Ancient Roman,Marble,Portrait Head of Emperor Hadrian,"Of all the Roman emperors, Hadrian (r. a.d. 117–38) is the one whose portrait is most frequently found, all across the empire from Britain to Persia, from Asia Minor to Egypt. Furthermore, among all his portraits, few equal this likeness in conveying the complex character of the emperor who inherited the Roman world at its greatest extent from his fellow Spaniard Trajan (r. a.d. 98–117). Hadrian traveled widely, visiting most of the provinces during the twenty years of his reign, and commissioned buildings, aqueducts, and roads in many cities. Citizens responded to Hadrian’s generosity by erecting numerous statues in his honor, and after his death they revered him as a god.Hadrian greatly admired the Greeks. Unlike previous emperors, who were cleanshaven, Hadrian wore a beard, perhaps in emulation of the Greek philosophers whom he so revered. Here Hadrian’s closely cropped beard contrasts with the thick, luxurious curls that frame his face. This sculpture also features an innovative trend in Roman portraiture: the artist carefully sculpted the irises and pupils of the eyes rather than rendering them in paint as was conventional.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/58135/portrait-head-of-emperor-hadrian
itl_57,Giorgio Vasari,Oil on panel,The Temptation of Saint Jerome,"Best known for his Lives of the Artists, a monumental compendium of biographies, Giorgio Vasari was a successful architect and a prolific painter for the Medici dukes of Florence. As a learned artist, he imparted an allegorical element to this frequently depicted episode from the life of Saint Jerome. The saint—a scholar, translator of the Bible, and advocate of monasticism—vividly described the tempting visions that assailed him when he retreated to the desert to meditate. In this painting, Jerome contemplates a crucifix; his visions are personified as Venus, the goddess of love, accompanied by cupids. Although Venus seems to flee, one of the troublesome cupids still aims his arrow at the saint. The work is unfinished: the black-chalk grid, used as aid in enlarging and transferring the preparatory drawing onto the panel, is still visible through the initial thinly applied paint layers.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/110242/the-temptation-of-saint-jerome

The first painting depicts John twice, leaving civilization—marked by ornate buildings and manicured agricultural fields—and entering the wilderness to become a hermit. In the next scene, John wears a hair shirt, symbolizing his ascetic life in the wilderness, as he announces that Jesus, at his right, is the savior prophesied as the agnus dei, the Lamb of God.The following three panels depict John the Baptist’s imprisonment and execution at the hands of Herod, ruler of Galilee. According to one version of the story, Herod—seen in blue at the head of the table in the fourth panel from the left—was so taken by his stepdaughter Salome’s dancing that he reluctantly obliged when she requested John’s beheading (visualized gruesomely in the fifth panel).

In style, technique, and the use of both Latin and Greek inscriptions, it shows a mixture of Eastern and Western elements. The diptych may have been made by an Italian craftsman, possibly working in the coastal city of Acre, which was the capital of a reduced crusader kingdom in the late 13th century. This type of private devotional work, and related Byzantine models imported back into Western Europe, exerted a powerful influence on later painting in Italy, France, and the Low Countries.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16241/diptych-of-the-virgin-and-child-enthroned-and-the-crucifixion

Here, Cristoforo Stati emphasized Samson’s bulging muscles as he effortlessly tears apart the lion’s jaw. Stati studied in Florence under Flemish-born artist Jean de Boulogne, called Giambologna. In 1601 Ferdinando I de’ Medici, Archduke of Tuscany, sent a sculpture of Samson by Giambologna as a diplomatic gift to the Duke of Lerma, the prime minister of Spain. After that work traveled from Florence to Lerma’s palace in Valladolid, the duke sought another scene to pair with it and commissioned Giambologna’s follower, Stati. In the ensuing years, the Spanish capital moved from Valladolid back to Madrid, where the sculpture seen here was installed. Stati created the twisting figures to complement the work of his mentor, who favored compositions meant to be viewed from all sides.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/146875/samson-and-the-lion

As subtle hints towards his eventual victory over death, wind animates his loincloth and inflates the sail of a boat in the distance, while verdant plants shoot up from cracks in the rocky, arid terrain.

The boat bringing the knight from Armida’s island has just deposited him on the coast of Palestine. The magician of Ascalon uses Rinaldo’s shield to conjure the heroic deeds of his ancestors, urging him to live up to their legacy. In contrast to earlier canvases in the sequence, the young knight appears focused on his mission.

His work responded to developments in the painting of Andrea Mantegna, Albrecht Dürer, Giorgione, and Titian. In emulation of their atmospheric colorism, Giulio developed a method of engraving with flicks or dots, which produces subtle gradations of tone. Thus, he is credited with inventing the “dotted manner” print, which is exemplified in this impression of the Roman goddess of love and beauty.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/13636/woman-reclining-in-a-landscape
itl_83,Giambattista Tiepolo,Oil on canvas,Armida Abandoned by Rinaldo,"The third scene from Giovanni Battista Tiepolo’s four-part suite of decorations, this painting shows the emotional climax of the story. The knight Rinaldo has been persuaded by his companions, Carlo and Ubaldo, to renounce the love of the sorceress Armida. Bareheaded and pensive, Rinaldo has taken up his shield again and appears to hesitate as the older knights gesture toward the boat that will carry them back to the crusader army and Armida implores him to stay.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16492/armida-abandoned-by-rinaldo

Giordano’s artistic studies informed this monumental depiction of the myth of the founding of Rome. The Romans, plagued by a shortage of brides, invited the neighboring Sabines to a festival and then violently kidnapped their young women. Using the rapid, bold brushwork that earned him the nickname Luca fa presto (Luca paints quickly), Giordano wove vivid gestures and compositional inspiration from earlier treatments of the subject into one of his most theatrical and geometrically complex works.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/111620/the-abduction-of-the-sabine-women

Saint Francis swoons in ecstasy into the arms of an angel after meditating on the instruments used to torture Jesus, presented by another angel on the left.

itl_99,Amedeo Modigliani,Oil on canvas,Madam Pompadour,"Born of Jewish parents in the Italian coastal town of Leghorn, Amedeo Modigliani settled in Paris in 1906, where he developed friendships with Pablo Picasso , the poet Max Jacob, the sculptor Constantin Brancusi, and other members of the literary and artistic avant-garde, many of whom appear in his portraits. He led a notoriously bohemian life, shortened by a self-destructive use of alcohol and drugs. Modigliani produced his finest paintings between 1914 and his premature death in 1920. Within a limited range of subjects, mainly portraits and nudes, he developed a highly distinctive style of sensitively elongated forms.In this portrait, Modigliani’s emphasis is on a strong formal structure dominated by the grid in the background and the echoing curves of the sitter’s hat, shoulders, and features. There is none of the pathos often associated with his work. The artist seems instead to have invested this portrait with a note of ironic detachment, even humor, reflected in both the title of the painting (which refers to Madame de Pompadour, mistress of King Louis XV of France) and the expression of amused inscrutability worn by the sitter. Were painter and sitter perhaps both amused by the flamboyant hat? Modigliani’s skill in rhyming forms, while at the same time keeping us visually interested and slightly off-balance, is evident throughout the picture, which resonates with the lessons of Paul Cezanne, Cubism, and African sculpture.The sitter for this portrait may well have been Beatrice Hastings, an English poetess who was Modigliani’s mistress at the time. Because of the artist’s tendency to generalize his sitter’s features, however, a comparison of this portrait with others of Hastings is inconclusive.—Entry, Margherita Andreotti, Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies, Vol. 20, No. 2, The Joseph Winterbotham Collection at The Art Institute of Chicago (1994), p. 150-151.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/27281/madam-pompadour

In this lyrical late work by Botticelli, two angels draw back curtains to reveal the Virgin and Child, who are framed by slender trees in a setting suggesting a throne. The intimate presentation of the holy figures and Christ’s gesture of blessing suggest that this small painting served a private devotional function.

Francesco de Mura spent most of his career in Naples but also worked for the king of Savoy in the 1740s, producing paintings in a style that combined grand, calm figures with active drapery.

The infant gives Saint Dominic a rosary; the saint had founded a preaching order that was closely associated with the use of the rosary as a spiritual exercise.

In the image represented, as well as its medium, technique and style, the drawing relates to Raphael’s most important commissions from this period; the Transfiguration altarpiece, now in the Pinacoteca Vaticana (Dussler 1971, pp. 52-55, pl. 111), which he completed shortly before his death on April 6, 1520; and the decoration of the walls of the Sala di Costantino, the largest of the papal suite of rooms in the Vatican (Dussler, pp. 86-88, pls. 143-44; Quednau 1979). With the possible exception of two allegorical figures in oil, this project, which was underway by late 1519, was largely executed by Raphael’s assistants under the direction of Giulio Romano, and completed in 1524. Although the Sala’s general decorative scheme was devised by Raphel, there are still questions concerning the extent of his responsibility for the design of individual components (Oberhuber/Fischel 1972, pp. 184-204).The gesture itself, of the upraised right arm and hand with palm facing outward, is reminiscent of that of Christ in the Transfiguration, as conveyed in two modelli, possibly by Giovanni Francesco Penni, in the Louvre (3954; Cordellier/Py 1992, pp. 533-34, no. 905, repr.) and the Albertina (193; Birke/Kertész 1992-, vol. 1, pp. 110-11, repr.), which preserve two abandoned designs for the Transfiguration. In both modelli, Christ’s arm is dramatically bent and thereby foreshortened as in the Chicago drawing, whereas in the actual painting, the same arm is more fully extended within the picture plane. Although it is conceivable that Raphael would have executed a detail study for this important gesture even in the early planning stages, it is unlikely that the Chicago drawing represents this study.Despite morphological similarities between the classically proportioned fingers and thumb, and those of the hands of the two apostles in an auxiliary black chalk cartoon for the Transfiguration in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford (P II 568; Joannides 1983, no. 437, pl. 38), the hard consistency of the black chalk in the Chicago drawing and the overall polished surface conflict stylistically with the softer chalk employed in the Ashmolean cartoon, and the resulting atmospheric, painterly effect produced by the merging of contours and smudged parallel hatching in that sheet. Moreover, the outlines of what appear to be a cowl or cope in the upper arm are not consonant with the unspecified, toga-like drapery arrangement given to Christ in both the modelli and the final painting.Although the Chicago drawing may have derived from an abandoned idea Raphael had for Christ’s right arm in the Transfiguration, it bears a much more precise relationship with the upraised right arm and hand of Saint Peter in the Sala di Costantino (Fig. 36; Quednau, pp. 181-204, pl. 33). Attended by the personifications of Ecclesia and Eternity, Saint Peter is one of eight early popes enthroned in niches, and flanking four narrative scenes from the history of Constantine, represented as feigned tapestries on each of the four walls. Peter is immediately identifiable by the pair of large keys he grasps in the his left hand, symbolizing Christ’s charge to him in Matthew 16:18-19. His right hand, with palm facing outward, is raised in a ceremonial gesture that at the time could have been interpreted as blessing or commanding (Quednau, pp. 182, 654-55 n. 615), but in either case would have reinforced the message of papal supremacy proclaimed throughout the room. In this particular case, the Biblical legitimacy of the pope’s role as successor to Peter, Christ’s vicar (then being undermined by Martin Luther), was underscored by the flanking figures of Ecclesia, who holds up a model of the church that Peter was to establish on earth, and Eternity, who symbolized the heavenly kingdom.Several key elements are held in common by the Chicago drawing and the relevant portion of the fresco of Saint Peter, which suggests that it served as a preparatory study for this detail. Beyond the similar gesture of the hand, and foreshortened arm, there is a clear connection between the cope worn by Peter, and the corresponding outline in the drawing, while the crumpled cuff in both fresco and drawing is virtually identical. In addition, the light in the drawing falls from the left, as it does in the fresco, which was located at the northern end of the east wall, receiving direct light from the nearest of the two windows on the north wall facing the courtyard of the Belvedere (for relevant photograph, see Oberhuber/Fischel 1972, fig. 203). While the general patterns of light and shadow created by Raphael in the drawing are maintained in the fresco, there are noteworthy differences in the specific treatment of the hand as painted by Giulio Romano. The fingers are more curved and have acquired a gnarled and swollen quality, but, more strikingly, the palm has been stretched disproportionately wide, and the fingers elongated, in keeping with Giulio’s exaggerated treatment of such morphological details in drawings for his earliest independent works, such as a black chalk study at Windsor Castle (0339) for a nude figure in the Martyrdom of Saint Stephen, of 1521/23 (New York 1987, no. 62 repr.). Here, the man’s upraised right hand, albeit not treated in as much detail, provides an instructive comparison, not only in the floppy, elongated fingers themselves, but in the relief-like treatment of the entire figure, and the lack of any underlying anatomical structure.Although there are no other detailed hand studies associated with the Sala di Costantino, the Chicago drawing compares well in its technique and style to two of the small group of figure studies accepted as being by Raphel: A study in the Uffizi (542 E.) for an advancing soldier in the Adlocutio of Constantine, the narrative scene to the right of Saint Peter (Oberhuber/Fischel 1972, p. 201. no. 484, pl. 84; Joannides 1983, p. 244, no. 444r, repr.), and a study in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford (P II 569), for two soldiers struggling in the water in the right foreground of the Battle of the Milvian Bridge, on the south wall of the Sala di Costantino (Oberhuber/Fischel, p. 204, no. 487, pl. 86; Joannides, pp. 120-21, pl 44; New York 1987, no. 40 repr.). Like the Chicago drawing, these are executed with swift strokes of black chalk and patches of white heightening over a fine network of stylus lines, creating in each case an expressive form whose surface texture is modeled by the particular pattern of light and shadow dictated by its placement in the complex illusionistic scheme conceived by Raphael. As Paul Joannides has observed, the bodies of the submerged soldiers are intentionally rendered as smoother and more generalized than that of the advancing soldier, in part because “their slickness of surface emphasizes their wetness,” but also because the advancing soldier required more detail, given his placement on the east wall, which received brighter, less diffused light. Although the Chicago drawing shares this more detailed treatment of surface with the Uffizi soldier, its style is perceptibly harder, particularly in the areas of the lower palm and the wrist, where the short, black chalk strokes are not blurred and softened with stumping or white heightening, but seem to stitch a taut impenetrable fabric, which coolly reflects the passage of light and shadow. Such detailing of the surface of Peter’s hand, as specified in the preparatory study, would have been necessitated by the figure’s proximity to the raking light coming from the north window. Without diminishing the inherent organic vitality of the hand emerging from the sleeve, Raphael intentionally endowed both with a marble-like sheen in order to establish clearly for the executant the illusionistic role played by the sculptural form of the enthroned Peter.— Entry, Italian drawings before 1600 in the Art Institute of Chicago, 1997, p.205.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/114932/upraised-right-hand-with-palm-facing-outward-study-for-saint-peter

According to the story on which the painting is based, the woman’s fiancé, shown kneeling beside her, was a powerful prince who agreed to a military alliance with Scipio in gratitude for his lenience.

The verso depicts a carefully drawn Turkish-style quiver with arrows and a bowcase with a bow and arrow. The recto contains two distinctly different subjects and styles: at the top, in the verso’s precise pen style, is an ornamented scabbard; below it, more hastily sketched in pen and brown ink, are a mounted rider in hunting attire and three standing men wearing unusual hats.Adolfo Venturi (1939) first linked this sheet (then in a private collection, Rome) with a similar sketchbook page in the Louvre (M.I. 1062; Fossi Todorow 1966, pls. 68, 70). The Louvre sheet bears an inscription describing the quiver, bow and scabbard drawn on the Chicago sheet, suggesting they were contiguous pages in a sketchbook (Fasanelli 1965). Both sheets document the visit of the Byzantine emperor John VIII Palaeologus and Joseph II, patriarch of the Eastern Orthodox Church, to Ferrara, where a Council of Churches was convened in early 1438. The Council moved in 1439 to Florence and drew together the leaders of the Christian world, both East and West. It focused not only on dogmatic differences between the Orthodox and Roman churches, but also on their mutual concern with repelling the Moslem forces threatening the Eastern empire.The Louvre drawing’s inscriptions refer to the costume of John VIII Palaeologus and mention Sultan El Moaid-Abuk-El Nasr (1422-38); it contains sketchy standing figures like those in Chicago and bust-length portraits, primarily with extravagant headgear. The mounted figure on the Louvre sheet is recognizable as a preliminary sketch for Pisanello’s commemorative portrait medallion of the emperor (Vickers 1978, figs. 1-2), probably finished in 1439.The figures on the Chicago sheet, however, have been the subject of controversy. Originally, the horseman was thought to be the aged patriarch (Venturi 1939), but James Fasanelli (1965) suggested that the figures are only members of the Greek retinue observed in procession (including a mounted squire-dwarf) and not the principals of the Council. Michael Vickers (1978) convincingly argued that both the Chicago and Louvre sheets are almost exclusively devoted to studies of the emperor and that neither sheet bears a portrait of the patriarch. Pisanello’s medallion supports this view: while one side bears the profile portrait of the emperor, the other shows him on horseback in a landscape, equipped with the very quiver, bow, and scabbard found on the Chicago sheet.Based on his study of the short, “stoop-shouldered” emperor and his habits, Vickers identified not only the figure on horseback, but also the two figures at the right of the Chicago sheet, as sketches of the emperor, wearing the ceremonial robes he had received from the Sultan of Egypt. In addition, the frontal study shows him with the same short, forked beard found in Piero della Francesca’s portrayal of him as Constantine the Great in the Arezzo frescoes, including the Victory of Constantine over Maxentius (Hendy 1968, pp. 85, 91, pl. 34). Pisanello’s experimentation with postures and garb led him ultimately to opt for a mounted image in hunting attire, as the emperor seems to have spent most of his time hunting in late 1438 while staying as a guest in a convent near Ferrara. Vladimir Juren (1973, pp. 222-25) noted that John VIII Palaeologus and his brother, the despot Demetrios, bought horses for hunting from the Russian delegation when they arrived in late August of that year.Indeed, the only figure not certainly the emperor is the central one, seen from the back and singled out by the inscription above it, variously read as “chalone” (cardinal’s hat, as Harold Joachim believed) or as “chaloire,” a phonetic interpretation of the vocative of the Greek work “kalogeros,” or “monk” (suggested by Ulrich Middeldorf, among others). The validity of this latter interpretation was questioned by Robert Munman (in Dunbar/Olszewski 1996), who indicated that the label was likely meant to identify a particular person, probably an ecclesiastic.Both the Louvre and Chicago sheets, thus dated to Pisanello’s later years, simultaneously document his old-fashioned, model-book delineation of ornamental motifs and his pioneering exploration of the effects of on-the spot reportage in studies from life, drawn in what Enio Sidona (1961, p. 73) called “small, comma-like strokes…with greater vitality.” Maria Fossi Todorow (1966, p. 31) rightly stressed that these drawings represent a pivotal moment in Pisanello’s stylistic development away from the International Gothic tradition of Gentile da Fabriano and toward an increasing concern with the expression of light, modeling, and movement, aspects more closely related to his activity as a medalist. Dominique Cordellier (in Paris 1996a, p. 197) observed that the Louvre and Chicago sheets must have been made on one of the rare public appearances of the emperor and the patriarch Joseph II, such as the first dogmatic session of the council in Ferrara on October 8, 1438.— Entry, Italian drawings before 1600 in the Art Institute of Chicago, 1997, p.192.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/113568/sketches-of-the-emperor-john-viii-palaeologus-a-monk-and-a-scabbard

Attracted to unconventional, humble materials—such as tar, sand, and enamel— and processes like collage, Burri made work that is related to the European Informel movement and the Art Brut of Jean Dubuffet and is seen as a precursor to Arte Povera. Using a restricted palette of red and black, Burri established a simplicity and directness in his abstract work. Mold, a mixed-media painting, is from a series in which he explored the use of pumice stone.

Draped cloth partially covers the figure’s chest and she wears a headband, or diadem, whose 13 stars signify the nation’s first states. This classicizing bust is drawn from Powers’s full-scale sculpture, similarly called America, in which the woman triumphantly raises one arm and stands upon broken chains. Living in Florence, Powers supported the uprisings there for a republican government. An abolitionist, he also strove to reaffirm the ideals of liberty and self-governance at home, where slavery—fueled by a white colonialist drive to expand westward—threatened the Union in the 1850s.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/64076/america

Perillus was rewarded by being the contraption’s first victim. In the Renaissance, this story was interpreted as a moral fable of ow bad advice rebounds on the giver, and it is here presented against the backdrop of a large Renaissance piazza. The relief is attributed to Giovanni Caccini on the basis of its stylistic relationship to his best-known work, the bronze panes of the doors of Pisa Cathedral (1604).",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/29431/phalaris-and-the-bull-of-perillus
itl_229,Bernardino Nocchi,Oil on canvas,Deposition (after Antonio Canova),"As ofﬁcial painter of the Apostolic Apartments, Bernardino Nocchi produced large fresco decorations for the papal residences at the Vatican. However, this painting is a reﬂection of his association with the great Neoclassical sculptor Antonio Canova—and of Canova’s exacting working process, which involved two-dimensional preparatory works as well as studies in terracotta and plaster. The plaster model was a key element in Canova’s design process, serving as the basis for adjustments before the ﬁnal execution in marble. In a few instances, as here, Canova also commissioned paintings based on the plaster model, both to show to the patron and to anticipate the effects of light on the three-dimensional work. The plaster model for this tomb design survives in the Gipsoteca Canoviana, Possagno, Italy, but a large marble was never made. A reduced replica made for a Venetian patron by Antonio d’Este, the head of Canova’s workshop, is also in the collection of the Art Institute.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/217534/deposition-after-antonio-canova

Refusing a defined, static style, stressing the need for art to be involved in real life with living substances, and demonstrating a commitment to constant change and experimentation, these artists used unconventional materials in an attempt to make the experience of art more immediately real. Calzolari’s early sculptural work often combines ephemeral organic materials—tobacco leaves, rose petals, feathers, moss, ice, and even flames—with technological ones, such as metal and neon, to reveal the conflict between the natural and the man-made. Here the Italian phrase, which translates as “In my 25th year,” adds an open-ended statement about the artist’s age to the spiral shape and tobacco leaves, which intimate a state of transformation.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/145837/untitled

This portrait was carved from a layered piece of agate with brown and white bands so that the figure of the emperor stands out against the dark background.

They build a city, which Aeneas names Pergamum, but are struck by a wretched plague, which brings a year of death to humans and animals.

The statue type, which is likely based on an earlier Greek bronze statue of Aphrodite created by the sculptor Kallimachos, became popular after Julius Caesar, who claimed the goddess as his ancestress, dedicated a version of this statue in a temple to Venus Genetrix. This statue type was also used in portraits of Roman empresses, who, in producing future emperors, likened themselves to Venus as mothers of the imperial line.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/40164/fragment-of-a-statue-of-venus

The artist invented the stipple engraving technique seen here, which was especially popular for reproductions in the 18th and 19th centuries, and he produced this work almost entirely out of dots and flecks.

The sketchy engraving style of Domenico Campagnola underlines the vigorous and impulsive nature of his figures. Body proportions are distorted in order to connote pain.

itl_352,Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo,"Wood, gessoed and lacquered with polychrome decoration and gilding",Door,"First sparked by the accounts of Marco Polo’s 13th-century voyage to China, the Italian vogue for chinoiserie (Chinese-inspired motifs) was later reinforced by the Venetian Republic’s extensive trade with the East. The city-state’s aristocrats ordered entire rooms to be decorated in Chinese style. One palace on the Grand Canal, the Ca’Rezzonico, now a museum of decorative arts, was lavishly decorated by the Rezzonico family after they purchased it in 1750. In addition to commissioning the painter Giovanni Battista Tiepolo and his son Giandomenico to create frescoes for the ceilings, the Rezzonicos followed contemporary fashion by decorating at least one room with Orientalist motifs.This door from the palace depicts two scenes that provide glimpses of Western perceptions of the East. In the upper panel, a noble couple meets in front of a palm tree; in the lower panel, a pipe-smoking potentate is being served tea. Both scenes are framed by bright sprays of flowers connected with flowing ribbons. The smooth, many layered surface of the lemon yellow door was achieved through lacquering, a technique borrowed from China but practiced in the West with an oil-based mixture rather than the resin-based one employed by Chinese craftsmen.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/79763/door

Shocked by his own actions, John throws the princess from a cliff and vows never to rise from the ground in penance for his misdeeds. After the princess and her child are miraculously discovered still alive, John’s sins are forgiven.

The front of this urn is adorned with heart-shaped ivy leaves and an inscription that identifies the deceased, a young woman named Plautia Hesperis.

The figures occupy an open-air architectural space with a gateway and pinnacled walls. This is the second state of Benedetto Montagna’s engraving; the saint is shown in three-quarter profile, and the princess looks directly at the saint.

Given how modestly Apollo was originally endowed, this change does not significantly alter the image overall. Rather, the god’s sizable arrow quiver dangles more provocatively between his legs than his own penis ever did.

Later, Rembrandt also copied the same drawing, and may have owned it for a time. Mocetto altered the composition by placing the scene, an allegory of calumny (or false accusation), in the Campo de Santi Giovanni e Paolo in Venice, with Andrea del Verrocchio’s famous equestrian monument to Bartolomeo Colleoni in the background.

A unique example in a canonical folding fan shape depicts a stag hunt. This undated proof is trimmed just outside the platemark, showing that the plate was cut to follow the shape of the accessory it depicted.

Under Fiorelli, archaeological evidence was to be documented at the site of its discovery, a dramatic shift from the antiquarian emphasis on aesthetics toward an anthropological appreciation of social and material context.

Albrecht Dürer met Barbari in Venice and was reportedly fascinated by Barbari’s idiosyncratic approach to human proportions, which led to Dürer’s own treatise on the subject (published in 1528). For this engraving Barbari depicted the three bound nude male figures each in a different pose, showing either the front, side, or back. Artists often adopted this conceit in order to prove their mastery of the body in three dimensions.

In true Renaissance form, the artists infused every inch of the image with a theatrical blend of mythology and antique ornament. Cupids gleefully urinate into one another’s vases in one of Giovanni Antonio’s columns, while half-armors and the spoils of war depicted throughout reinforce the Roman love of ancient history.

Designs were often engraved on silver and then dusted with niello, a powdered metallic alloy. When heated, the enamel-like amalgam fused into the engraved lines. The surface of the metal was then polished, highlighting the black design. An artist could proof his work by rubbing ink into the lines and printing the design on dampened paper. This work was once attributed to the goldsmith Maso Finiguerra (1426-1464), the most famous niellist of his day. It is now thought to be an 18th­ century production based on earlier Florentine models, but it nonetheless conveys the jewel-like quality of Finiguerra’ s art.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/4228/adoration-of-the-magi

Dark backgrounds and pronounced contours are common characteristics of niello plate designs. As paper became more readily available in the 15th century, silversmiths made impressions from the niello plates on sheets to check their progress or record their designs. Growing interest in these small pictures soon led artists to engrave plates for the sole purpose of making prints.Mythological subjects were the most popular niello plates. This print depicts Orpheus, son of the Greek god Apollo, playing music so skillfully that he allures the beasts around him. After the death of his wife, Eurydice, he traveled to the underworld to bring her back. Although he was unsuccessful in his mission, Orpheus became one of a select few who had journeyed to hell and back. For this feat, Dante included Orpheus in the Inferno, among the other ancient poets who reside in limbo.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/4352/orpheus-charming-the-animals

The term refers to a family of edged weapons attached to wooden staffs. With the exception of the lance, which remained the weapon of the mounted knight, all other staff weapons were wielded by men on foot by 1600. With the development of firearms and their introduction as infantry weapons, pole arms lost their importance on the field, and from the mid-16th century, they were reserved for use in sporting contests and by princely bodyguards for ceremony and parade. The blades lent themselves to embellishment—engraving, etching, or other forms of decoration—and provided a perfect surface for the coats of arms of noble or princely families. The ceremonial use of staff weapons continues to this day with the Swiss Guards at the Vatican and Britain’s Yeomen of the Royal Guard.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/106518/gunner-s-linstock-matchholder-combined-with-spear

This plaque would have been a small devotional object for a wealthy household and was probably made in Rome during the last quarter of the 16th century, when there was a revival of such decoration.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/40680/plaque-with-virgin-and-child

Oberhu­ber’s identification of the scene as the meeting of Anna and Joachim at the Golden Gate has been generally accepted, although Walter Vitzthum suggested that the drawing represented Ulysses’ reunion with Penelope.Diane De Grazia proposed a later date, demonstrating that the drawing reveals the influence of Giulio Romano on Bedoli after the latter’s first documented stay in Man­tua of 1552. In its broad sculptural forms and tight contours, the sheet closely resembles several securely dated works by Bedoli from this later period, including a pen and wash preparatory study in the Uffizi for the Adoration of the Shepherds (13179 F.) of c. 1553 in Santa Maria della Steccata, Parma. A. E. Popham noted that the Chicago drawing compares closely with one at Christ Church, Oxford (0419), which Philip Pouncey had attributed to Bedoli and which features a similar couple, tentatively identified as Augustus and the Sibyl, standing beneath a classical arch.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/85775/the-meeting-of-joachim-and-anna-at-the-golden-gate

Palagi was responsible for the interior design, including the walls, ceilings, mantels and doorways, and also for the palace furniture, including a suite of six side chairs, four armchairs, and two sofas. The Art Institute’s side chair comes from this set.Palagi used late-Neoclassical motifs in original ways on this furniture. The crest of the chair rail is adorned with three-dimensional carving of palmettes and lotuses, inspired by natural forms but arranged in such a way as to give an almost military rigor to the design. The inlaid friezes below repeat the palmette motif and also incorporate sinuous vines and tendrils. Thanks to the survival of the original dark blue and white upholstery on several of the pieces and the discovery of a panel of the original fabric in the Musée des Tissus (Museum of Fabrics) in Lyons, France, the original upholstery is reproduced here. The fabric on the seat shows a lyre flanked by swans, while the fabric on the chair back displays a large rosette framed by a border of leaves—all motifs that have time-honored associations with beauty, poetry, and classical culture.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/109931/side-chair

Instead, these delicately engraved didactic allegories are grouped in five numbered ranks describing the workings of the spheres of man, the muses, the liberal arts, the cosmos, and the heavens in order of increasing significance, and offer a didactic sequence to educate courtly youths or possibly university students, who could have used them as flashcards or a pamphlet.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/11467/erato-plate-fourteen-from-apollo-and-the-muses

This secular engraving (representing two lovers acting out of ulterior, financial motives) is one case in which the print media matches the original. Stylistically, there is no comparison between the intricacy of Dürer’s lines and Marcantonio’s dryer flecks and outlines. But contemporary buyers did not always know the difference.

The skull at his feet corresponds to his period of penance, in which he lived humbly in the desert and became interested in studying and writing.

E.’s Adoration of the Shepherds is an unusually windblown and eerie envisioning of the scene, set in an architectural framework more reminiscent of a ruined temple than a stable.

First published in 1699, it was one of the most popular books of the 1700s and 1800s.Telemachus is the son of Ulysses from Homer’s Odyssey, the first four books of which describe the hero’s search for his father. Fénelon invented further adventures for Telemachus, in which he undergoes many trials while accompanied by his tutor, Mentor, who is actually the goddess Minerva (the embodiment of wisdom) in human disguise. A scathing critique of autocratic government and a diatribe against war, the book denounces luxury and decadence and calls for the simplicity and equality Fénelon believed ancient Greece best exemplified.Pinelli illustrated scenes from books 1–8 and one scene from book 18, and probably planned to illustrate more from the 24 books of the text. Throughout, he celebrates the heroic nude, displaying a deep knowledge of ancient Roman sculpture. His style, influenced by Jacques-Louis David and John Flaxman, is characterized by bold, almost cartoonish contours, monochromatic washes, and frieze-like arrangements of figures.On the galley after making their escape from Calypso’s island, Telemachus and Mentor are entertained by the musician Achitoas. He sings and plays his lyre with such skill that the tritons, nereids, and other gods of the sea gather around the ship to listen.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/17984/telemachus-and-mentor-in-a-galley-after-fleeing-the-island-of-calypso-from-the-adventures-of-telemachus-book-8

Annibale Carracci himself painted it no less than six times. This print, which marks his return to printmaking after a brief hiatus, signals a mature use of the medium of etching to give immediacy to a familiar theme. By employing an unusually fine etching tool as well as the drypoint technique, the artist produced shimmering lines that emphasize the mood of agitated mourning.

The assembled composition would fit only on a massive wall, a use confirmed by the total lack of early impressions. Only this 1549 state is known, printed from woodblocks studded with wormholes, which appear in the image as tiny white dots. The inscription at lower center of The Submersion describes the Israelites’ persecution under the Egyptian pharaoh and his army’s fate when they followed Moses into the Red Sea.

Campagnola depicted Ganymede in flight, with a draping sash billowing in the wind to depict movement. The landscape below derives directly from Dürer’s Madonna with the Monkey (c. 1499).

Although with the exception of Apollo, no specific gods or Muses are identified in either the Marcantonio print or the Raphael painting, mortal poets such as Dante Alighieri feature in both.

itl_731,Ancient Roman,Silver,Denarius (Coin) Portraying Julius Caesar,"Portraits of important people appear on local currency all around the world. The same was true in ancient Rome, which began producing its first coinage in the late 4th century BCE. Early coins depicted the heads of gods and goddesses on the front side, often in profile, while the back depicted animals, natural resources, symbols, and references to historical events. It was not until 44 BC that the portrait of a living person—Julius Caesar—appeared on coins. Thereafter, profile portraits of rulers or other members of the imperial family became the standard subject on coins throughout the Roman Empire.Inscriptions on coins help identify the ruler. While the front side depicted the sovereign’s portrait, the back was often used to communicate the ruler’s accomplishments or aspirations. Until Late Antiquity, portraits usually appeared in profile. The tiny images were carved by engravers into bronze dies, with one for the front and another for the back. The coins were then struck, one by one, in a process similar to how coins are created today.The front (obverse) of this coin portrays Julius Caesar facing right. The back (reverse) depicts the goddess Venus to the left, with a scepter and caduceus.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/9934/denarius-coin-portraying-julius-caesar

First published in 1699, it was one of the most popular books of the 1700s and 1800s.Telemachus is the son of Ulysses from Homer’s Odyssey, the first four books of which describe the hero’s search for his father. Fénelon invented further adventures for Telemachus, in which he undergoes many trials while accompanied by his tutor, Mentor, who is actually the goddess Minerva (the embodiment of wisdom) in human disguise. A scathing critique of autocratic government and a diatribe against war, the book denounces luxury and decadence and calls for the simplicity and equality Fénelon believed ancient Greece best exemplified.Pinelli illustrated scenes from books 1–8 and one scene from book 18, and probably planned to illustrate more from the 24 books of the text. Throughout, he celebrates the heroic nude, displaying a deep knowledge of ancient Roman sculpture. His style, influenced by Jacques-Louis David and John Flaxman, is characterized by bold, almost cartoonish contours, monochromatic washes, and frieze-like arrangements of figures.Shipwrecked after many adventures, Telemachus is washed ashore on the island of Calypso, where his father, Ulysses, had been held unwillingly for seven years and has only recently departed. As she had with Ulysses, Calypso develops a passion for Telemachus. In this scene, he relates his adventures to the goddess and her court of nymphs.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/17971/telemachus-relates-his-adventures-to-the-goddess-calypso-from-the-adventures-of-telemachus-book-1

Easy to miss, Angelica lies naked in the left foreground spot-lit by a patch of sunlight (really just the exposed white of the paper).Giani’s rapid-fire, staccato pen strokes give the sheet a feeling of vibrant energy and movement akin to the fast pacing of the poem.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/113989/angelica-resting-under-a-tree-from-orlando-furioso

Mantegna captured the classical antiquarian essence of ancient Rome through his depiction of architectural practices of the era, such as the aedicula framing the window in the center of this image.

This technique approximated painting’s subtle transitions from light to dark values. This print may be after a composition, now lost, by Giorgione or Titian, both of whom were from Venice where Campagnola worked.

Futility (foul and rabbit) and artistic creativity (pallet, brushes, and sheet music) are at Fame’s feet.Heralded as one of the most creative etchers in Italy, Castiglione was inspired by Dutch artists’ work, particularly the etchings of Rembrandt van Rijn, whose prints were imported from Amsterdam to Genoa by Dutch dealers.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/40826/the-genius-of-castiglione

Each “performance” or installation of the work could be different.

First published in 1699, it was one of the most popular books of the 1700s and 1800s.Telemachus is the son of Ulysses from Homer’s Odyssey, the first four books of which describe the hero’s search for his father. Fénelon invented further adventures for Telemachus, in which he undergoes many trials while accompanied by his tutor, Mentor, who is actually the goddess Minerva (the embodiment of wisdom) in human disguise. A scathing critique of autocratic government and a diatribe against war, the book denounces luxury and decadence and calls for the simplicity and equality Fénelon believed ancient Greece best exemplified.Pinelli illustrated scenes from books 1–8 and one scene from book 18, and probably planned to illustrate more from the 24 books of the text. Throughout, he celebrates the heroic nude, displaying a deep knowledge of ancient Roman sculpture. His style, influenced by Jacques-Louis David and John Flaxman, is characterized by bold, almost cartoonish contours, monochromatic washes, and frieze-like arrangements of figures.Freed from Egyptian captivity, Telemachus sails to Tyre, where he is warned of imminent danger; he leaves Tyre on a ship bound for Cyprus. During the voyage, Telemachus dreams that Minerva, goddess of Wisdom, protects him from Venus (who appears in her dove-drawn chariot) and her son Cupid, who attempts to pierce him with his arrow. He also dreams that Mentor, whose location is still unknown, tells him to flee from decadent Cyprus, an island devoted to Venus. On Cyprus, Telemachus is reunited with Mentor.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/17988/the-dream-of-telemachus-from-the-adventures-of-telemachus-book-4

itl_994,Rudolf Stingel,Oil and enamel on canvas,Untitled,"Featuring unusual and often banal materials such as industrial carpet and Styrofoam, Rudolf Stingel’s conceptual paintings and site-specific installations transform into dazzling pictorial statements. Sometimes produced through unexpected results, Stingel’s work deconstructs—and therefore demystifies—the processes of making art. His work often disrupts the perception of exhibition spaces and destabilizes the accepted hierarchy between the work and the context.Untitled is the first in Stingel’s series of iconic textural silver paintings—made by a process of coating the canvas in a single color, laying a piece of tulle over the surface, spraying the canvas with silver paint, and then removing the fabric to reveal lyrical, painterly creases on a luminous field of color. The silver surface disrupts the modernist monochrome, making it more contemporary, and adds a touch of glamour and decoration. Embracing nontraditional strategies in painting, as well as redefining the role of the artist, Stingel printed a step-by-step illustrated list of instructions in six languages, which reveals his technique and allows anyone who followed his “recipe” to create one of his paintings.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/186720/untitled

View of the Villa d’Este, Tivoli contrasts the ancient Roman statues on the grounds with the grandiose Mannerist-style villa.

First published in 1699, it was one of the most popular books of the 1700s and 1800s.Telemachus is the son of Ulysses from Homer’s Odyssey, the first four books of which describe the hero’s search for his father. Fénelon invented further adventures for Telemachus, in which he undergoes many trials while accompanied by his tutor, Mentor, who is actually the goddess Minerva (the embodiment of wisdom) in human disguise. A scathing critique of autocratic government and a diatribe against war, the book denounces luxury and decadence and calls for the simplicity and equality Fénelon believed ancient Greece best exemplified.Pinelli illustrated scenes from books 1–8 and one scene from book 18, and probably planned to illustrate more from the 24 books of the text. Throughout, he celebrates the heroic nude, displaying a deep knowledge of ancient Roman sculpture. His style, influenced by Jacques-Louis David and John Flaxman, is characterized by bold, almost cartoonish contours, monochromatic washes, and frieze-like arrangements of figures.The Phoenician ship on which Telemachus and Mentor are bound for Greece is attacked by the Egyptian fleet. Telemachus and Mentor are taken prisoner and brought to Egypt, where they are separated. Telemachus is enslaved and forced to tend sheep in the desert. In his despair at being unable to escape his fate, he is comforted in the wilderness by Termosiris, a priest of Apollo, who inspires him with courage.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/17981/telemachus-is-consoled-by-termosiris-priest-of-apollo-from-the-adventures-of-telemachus-book-2

First published in 1699, it was one of the most popular books of the 1700s and 1800s.Telemachus is the son of Ulysses from Homer’s Odyssey, the first four books of which describe the hero’s search for his father. Fénelon invented further adventures for Telemachus, in which he undergoes many trials while accompanied by his tutor, Mentor, who is actually the goddess Minerva (the embodiment of wisdom) in human disguise. A scathing critique of autocratic government and a diatribe against war, the book denounces luxury and decadence and calls for the simplicity and equality Fénelon believed ancient Greece best exemplified.Pinelli illustrated scenes from books 1–8 and one scene from book 18, and probably planned to illustrate more from the 24 books of the text. Throughout, he celebrates the heroic nude, displaying a deep knowledge of ancient Roman sculpture. His style, influenced by Jacques-Louis David and John Flaxman, is characterized by bold, almost cartoonish contours, monochromatic washes, and frieze-like arrangements of figures.To trick Telemachus into remaining with Calypso and giving up his search for his father, Venus sends her son, the god of love, whose flattery and cajoling have the desired effect upon Telemachus. Meanwhile, Mentor, seated at right accompanied by his attribute the owl (for he is Minerva, goddess of wisdom, in human form), looks on with disdain.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/17977/calypso-watches-telemachus-with-cupid-on-his-knee-while-mentor-watches-in-anger-from-the-adventures-of-telemachus-book-7

Filtered through the language and discipline of architecture, Rossi’s study of historical cities and “urban artifacts” informed remarkable designs based on primary geometric forms. Like the cube and hemisphere that populate his famous design for the Modena Cemetery, Rossi’s competition drawing for a new municipal building in the town of Muggiò, Italy, proposes a similar play of geometric solids, featuring a gridded structure that is split in two by a truncated cone. These forms refer to historical elements of the town, including the palatial blocks at the town center and a neoclassical villa in a local park. However, Rossi’s design is not reducible to a simple abstraction of existing buildings, as he understood architectural types as the embodiment of a complex network of social and political histories from his country’s past.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/70498/town-hall-of-muggio-italy-design-sketch

Instead, these delicately engraved didactic allegories are grouped in five numbered ranks describing the workings of the spheres of man, the muses, the liberal arts, the cosmos, and the heavens in order of increasing significance, and offer a didactic sequence to educate courtly youths or possibly university students, who could have used them as flashcards or a pamphlet.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/11457/the-merchant-plate-four-from-the-ranks-and-conditions-of-men

Such acts of aggression and self-laceration echo certain artistic trends, namely painterly abstraction, Dada, and Surrealism.

First published in 1699, it was one of the most popular books of the 1700s and 1800s.Telemachus is the son of Ulysses from Homer’s Odyssey, the first four books of which describe the hero’s search for his father. Fénelon invented further adventures for Telemachus, in which he undergoes many trials while accompanied by his tutor, Mentor, who is actually the goddess Minerva (the embodiment of wisdom) in human disguise. A scathing critique of autocratic government and a diatribe against war, the book denounces luxury and decadence and calls for the simplicity and equality Fénelon believed ancient Greece best exemplified.Pinelli illustrated scenes from books 1–8 and one scene from book 18, and probably planned to illustrate more from the 24 books of the text. Throughout, he celebrates the heroic nude, displaying a deep knowledge of ancient Roman sculpture. His style, influenced by Jacques-Louis David and John Flaxman, is characterized by bold, almost cartoonish contours, monochromatic washes, and frieze-like arrangements of figures.In her passion for Telemachus, and hoping to detain him on her island, Calypso requests the help of the goddess Venus. Here, Venus sends her son Cupid, who is referred to in the inscription as amore (love).",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/17968/venus-presents-cupid-to-calypso-from-the-adventures-of-telemachus-book-7

In the 18th century, Venice saw a printmaking revival due to an increase in tourists. As the demand for prints grew, Canaletto turned to etching to satisfy the tourists’ needs for souvenirs. Ale porto del Dolo shows a passenger barge leaving its dock on a side canal with the campanile of San Rocco at Dolo in the distance. By varying the direction and intensity of his etched line, Canaletto obtained shimmering silver tones with contrasting blacks and whites, capturing this humble scene with convincing illumination.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/159753/ale-porto-del-dolo

As the inscription describes, in the studio Alexander made many uninformed comments, and Apelles advised him to be silent, saying that the boys engaged in grinding colors were laughing at him. Like Apelles, Rosa had no qualms about declaring his superiority over his patrons.

Domenico Fetti also included an armillary sphere and telescope in the background on the left to reflect the scientific interests of the Mantuan court of his patron Ferdinando Gonzaga.

The flying putto heads in the cloudburst on either side exude a sense of calm and protection, while the detail of the Virgin’s sandaled foot anchors the pyramidal group on what would otherwise be an insubstantial wisp of cloud.

Yet Camillo used a sparer formal vocabulary in this depiction of a pivotal moment from Christ’s adulthood. Created at a similar scale as his brother’s painting, Camillo’s print was the largest etching produced in Italy to that date.

While Cantarini depicted Argus with two eyes, the giant was said to have a hundred. After Argus is killed by Mercury, his eyes decorate the peacock’s feathers.With its poetic effect and mature technical ability, this is one of the artist’s most prized etchings.

First published in 1699, it was one of the most popular books of the 1700s and 1800s.Telemachus is the son of Ulysses from Homer’s Odyssey, the first four books of which describe the hero’s search for his father. Fénelon invented further adventures for Telemachus, in which he undergoes many trials while accompanied by his tutor, Mentor, who is actually the goddess Minerva (the embodiment of wisdom) in human disguise. A scathing critique of autocratic government and a diatribe against war, the book denounces luxury and decadence and calls for the simplicity and equality Fénelon believed ancient Greece best exemplified.Pinelli illustrated scenes from books 1–8 and one scene from book 18, and probably planned to illustrate more from the 24 books of the text. Throughout, he celebrates the heroic nude, displaying a deep knowledge of ancient Roman sculpture. His style, influenced by Jacques-Louis David and John Flaxman, is characterized by bold, almost cartoonish contours, monochromatic washes, and frieze-like arrangements of figures.With a magical flute given to him by Termosiris, and inspired by Apollo, Telemachus sings and plays so beautifully that the neighboring shepherds gather in crowds around him. At the same time, the desert grows more verdant and its inhabitants more civilized.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/17991/telemachus-plays-and-sings-to-the-shepherds-in-egypt-from-the-adventures-of-telemachus-book-2

The assembled composition would fit only on a massive wall, a use confirmed by the total lack of early impressions. Only this 1549 state is known, printed from woodblocks studded with wormholes, which appear in the image as tiny white dots. The inscription at lower center of The Submersion describes the Israelites’ persecution under the Egyptian pharaoh and his army’s fate when they followed Moses into the Red Sea.

In this composition, the exaggerated movement of the trees and landscape is complicated by Joseph’s placement, leaning out into the viewer’s space—a typical Baroque device.

The many mythological creatures in this series, such as the Triton and Nereid, exemplify the grotesque decorative style that was popular at the time. Palaces, tombs, and villas in this style were unearthed around Rome and Naples, especially the Emperor Nero’s Domus Aurea palace, which had ancient wall paintings intact.

Described by Piranesi as a room belonging to the barracks of the Praetorian Guard, the so-called Hall of the Philosophers is now thought to have been a library used for important council meetings. The apsidal chamber was originally embellished with purple porphyry stone, a coffered ceiling, and imperial sculpture in the niches.

Silenus—Bacchus’s lustful, frequently inebriated companion—appears in a wine-induced stupor, empty pitcher in hand. The attendant teasingly trying to wake Silenus with a bunch of grapes (instead of more wine) may be a reference to the hangover relief now known as the hair of the dog, or in this case, the hair of the goat.

The naked man lounges in the pose of a statue of a river god, but his placement before an ancient altar relief, with a glimpse of a covered basket, implies that one of the ritual mysteries is taking place in conjunction with the wine consumption.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/45035/bacchanal

First published in 1699, it was one of the most popular books of the 1700s and 1800s.Telemachus is the son of Ulysses from Homer’s Odyssey, the first four books of which describe the hero’s search for his father. Fénelon invented further adventures for Telemachus, in which he undergoes many trials while accompanied by his tutor, Mentor, who is actually the goddess Minerva (the embodiment of wisdom) in human disguise. A scathing critique of autocratic government and a diatribe against war, the book denounces luxury and decadence and calls for the simplicity and equality Fénelon believed ancient Greece best exemplified.Pinelli illustrated scenes from books 1–8 and one scene from book 18, and probably planned to illustrate more from the 24 books of the text. Throughout, he celebrates the heroic nude, displaying a deep knowledge of ancient Roman sculpture. His style, influenced by Jacques-Louis David and John Flaxman, is characterized by bold, almost cartoonish contours, monochromatic washes, and frieze-like arrangements of figures.On their way from Greece to Italy, Telemachus and Mentor are shipwrecked by Neptune on the island of Calypso. Telemachus’s account of his adventures to Calypso ends here, and the next phase of his adventures begins.The owl shown here is Minerva’s attribute and signals that Mentor is Minerva. The word “mentor” that we use today comes from his name.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/17998/mentor-and-telemachus-having-survived-the-storm-are-spirited-to-the-island-of-calypso-on-a-mast-from-the-adventures-of-telemachus-book-6

He dedicated this portfolio to his major patron, the connoisseur Joseph Smith (here Italianized as Giuseppe Smith), who may have supported the project. A resident of Venice from 1700, Smith became the British consul in 1744 and acted as an agent of sorts, finding commissions for the artist.

Depicted is a scene from the story of Jacob, in the book of Genesis. After fleeing Laban’s house in the middle of the night, Jacob and his wives, Rachel and Leah, are overtaken by Laban, who searches for the household idols stolen by Rachel in an attempt to protect Jacob from another twenty years of labor under her father’s rule. The image demonstrates Castiglione’s preference for patriarchal themes and his tendency to place animals in the foreground of his compositions: two sheep rest in the left-hand corner.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/26739/laban-searching-for-family-idols-among-the-possessions-of-joseph

This ambitious composition reflects the influence of Rembrandt’s luminous compositions in which Christian tales are transformed into something metaphysical. The subject derives from the Golden Legend of Jacobus de Voraigne, which suggests that the saints’ bodies were cast into a well near the clandestine catacomb vault, seen here in Castiglione’s dramatic rendering.

Here Apollo, a wreathed Dionysos, and other gods watch as the Muses (the nudes at left) challenge the king’s daughters.

First published in 1699, it was one of the most popular books of the 1700s and 1800s.Telemachus is the son of Ulysses from Homer’s Odyssey, the first four books of which describe the hero’s search for his father. Fénelon invented further adventures for Telemachus, in which he undergoes many trials while accompanied by his tutor, Mentor, who is actually the goddess Minerva (the embodiment of wisdom) in human disguise. A scathing critique of autocratic government and a diatribe against war, the book denounces luxury and decadence and calls for the simplicity and equality Fénelon believed ancient Greece best exemplified.Pinelli illustrated scenes from books 1–8 and one scene from book 18, and probably planned to illustrate more from the 24 books of the text. Throughout, he celebrates the heroic nude, displaying a deep knowledge of ancient Roman sculpture. His style, influenced by Jacques-Louis David and John Flaxman, is characterized by bold, almost cartoonish contours, monochromatic washes, and frieze-like arrangements of figures.To prevent Telemachus from leaving, Calypso’s nymphs burn the ship that Mentor had constructed. Though Telemachus is secretly gladdened by this, Mentor pushes him off a cliff into the sea, where they swim to another ship to escape.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/17994/cupid-advises-calypso-to-set-fire-to-mentor-s-ship-from-the-adventures-of-telemachus-book-7

In true Renaissance form, the artists infused every inch of the image with a theatrical blend of mythology and antique ornament. Cupids gleefully urinate into one another’s vases in one of Giovanni Antonio’s columns, while half-armors and the spoils of war depicted throughout reinforce the Roman love of ancient history. The masked and hybrid creatures likely derive from grotteschi designs in Emperor Nero’s sunken Domus Aurea in Rome, which had been rediscovered and excavated in the decades before these prints were made.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/23442/two-children-wearing-helmets-plate-three-of-twelve-ornament-panels

In true Renaissance form, the artists infused every inch of the image with a theatrical blend of mythology and antique ornament. Cupids gleefully urinate into one another’s vases in one of Giovanni Antonio’s columns, while half-armors and the spoils of war depicted throughout reinforce the Roman love of ancient history.

The image draws much of its strength from its contrasts: Judith’s exposed breast and the bed-curtain emphasize her seductiveness, while her drawn sword reinforces her violent efficiency. Voids above the decapitated general’s body and beneath his dangling left arm evoke his disorienting inebriation and subsequent, violent end. Enveloped in her swirling robes, Judith has Holofernes’s head well in hand and is ready for the swift journey to her home, Bethulia, where she was rightly welcomed as a hero.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/218410/judith-with-the-head-of-holofernes

In true Renaissance form, the artists infused every inch of the image with a theatrical blend of mythology and antique ornament. Cupids gleefully urinate into one another’s vases in one of Giovanni Antonio’s columns, while half-armors and the spoils of war depicted throughout reinforce the Roman love of ancient history. The masked and hybrid creatures likely derive from grotteschi designs in Emperor Nero’s sunken Domus Aurea in Rome, which had been rediscovered and excavated in the decades before these prints were made.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/23432/griffins-and-two-cupids-crossing-halberds-plate-five-of-twelve-ornament-panels

Instead, these delicately engraved didactic allegories are grouped in five numbered ranks describing the workings of the spheres of man, the muses, the liberal arts, the cosmos, and the heavens in order of increasing significance, and offer a didactic sequence to educate courtly youths or possibly university students, who could have used them as flashcards or a pamphlet.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/122268/jupiter-plate-46-from-planets-and-spheres

Gioli made direct Polaroid impressions of an engraved portrait of the cardinal of Amboise that Niépce had used to create several heliographs, his early photographic invention. Following in Niépce’s experimental footsteps, Gioli tested the constraints of mass-produced instant film, cutting the freshly exposed film to extract the image-receiving layer and manipulate it further. Like specimens from the dawn of photography, these unique artworks defy common conceptions of photography—and also call for cautious handling and exhibition.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/100942/untitled-from-the-series-homage-to-niepce

During his sojourn in France, which lasted from 1639 until 1650, della Bella was supported in part by the sale of his many print series, such as Diverse Figures, which filled in the artistic gap left in Paris by Jacques Callot’s death in 1635.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/104282/standing-violinist-from-diverse-figures-from-the-countryside

The same was true in ancient Rome, which began producing its first coinage in the late 4th century BCE. Early coins depicted the heads of gods and goddesses on the front side, often in profile, while the back depicted animals, natural resources, symbols, and references to historical events. The denarius, introduced in 211 BCE, was the principal silver coin of Rome for five hundred years.

To mark and promote Borromeo’s beatification, in 1602, Nebbia was commissioned to decorate the ceiling and walls of the Collegio Borromeo, in Pavia, in his honor. While this drawing may have been intended for a never-completed fresco on the north or south wall, the two other drawings on view nearby were used for monochrome frescos. Borromeo’s case progressed to the Congregation of Rites in 1604, and he was officially canonized by Pope Paul V in 1610.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/223804/saint-charles-borromeo-entering-the-town-of-pavia-design-for-a-wall-decoration

The same was true in ancient Rome, which began producing its first coinage in the late 4th century BC. Early coins depicted the heads of gods and goddesses on the front side, often in profile, while the back depicted animals, natural resources, symbols, and references to historical events. It was not until 44 BCE that the portrait of a living person—Julius Caesar—appeared on coins. Thereafter, profile portraits of rulers or other members of the imperial family became the standard subject on coins throughout the Roman Empire.In the mid-50s BCE, it became common to portray ancestors that reinforced an important family lineage. The politician Lucius Marcius Philippus, who commissioned this coin, traced his lineage to the legendary King Ancus Marcius, who was believed to have lived in the late seventh century BCE.The front (obverse) of this coin depicts the head of King Ancus Marcius diademed and facing right; behind him is a lituus (curved augural staff). The back (reverse) of the coin depicts an equestrian statue facing right on an aqueduct between arches of which are the letters: AQVA MAR.

She made this engraving in Rome the same year she moved there and received a papal privilege protecting her prints from copyists. Her plates were evidently deemed valuable, as printers kept reprinting them.

In particular, she brought light to bear on Livio Agresti, a pupil of Perino del Vaga (1501–1547), one of Raphael’s closest assistants who continued his master’s work after his death in 1520. Agresti undertook a number of important projects at the Vatican for Pope Gregory XIII as well as for the Roman churches Santa Caterina dei Funari and Santo Spirito in Sassia.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/223806/saint-charles-borromeo-venerating-the-relics

This series described the life, from birth to death, of the tragicomic commedia dell’arte figure Punchinello (identified by his conical hat and beaked mask), in a loosely structured tale of an everyman.In Punchinello Collapses on the Road, we see the protagonist, surrounded by eleven of his companions and three lamenting women, in the final days before his death. While Punchinello is indeed a kind of everyman, Tiepolo also made references throughout the series to the life of Christ.

The latter refers to his First Labor, in which he killed a magical beast who was ravaging the town of Nemea.

The mosaic pattern was made by sagging molten glass into bowl-shaped molds, a technique used on many of these fragments is similar to millefiori, “thousand flowers” in Italian, a modern glass-making method in which tiny rods of colored glass are bundled together, wrapped in a sheet of glass, fused, and then thinly sliced to reveal swirls of a flower-like patterns.

itl_3115,Bernardino Lanino,"Brush with brown and black ink and brown wash, black chalk, heightened with white, on multiple sheets of pieced, blue laid paper (now discolored).","Madonna and Child, a Warrior Saint (Michael?), and a Group of Worshippers","This large-scale cartoon, a full-size preparatory model for an unidentified altarpiece, is made up of six sheets of paper pasted together. The group of young women on the right indicates that the final painting was probably intended for a female religious community. One figure was later transformed into a male through the addition of a beard.Trained in northern Italy, Bernardino Lanino was exposed to the work of Leonardo and absorbed his signature effects of chiaroscuro, strong contrasts of light and dark, and sfumato, softened outlines and hazy forms.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/204286/madonna-and-child-a-warrior-saint-michael-and-a-group-of-worshippers

itl_3778,Jacopino del Conte,Oil on panel,Madonna and Child with Saints Elizabeth and John the Baptist,"Mary holds the infant Jesus on her lap as she turns to her cousin Elizabeth, whose son, John the Baptist, kneels at her feet. John’s unlikely birth to the elderly Elizabeth prefigured the miraculous birth of Jesus, and John later preached to his divine cousin’s followers and baptized them into the faith. Here, the artist placed the biblical figures in a contemporary setting with recognizable elements of a 16th-century Florentine interior, including the portable terracotta vessel holding heated coals, called a brazier, and a fireplace made of gray sandstone (pietra serena).One of the most successful artists working in the Mannerist style, Jacopino del Conte had a long career in Florence and Rome that bridged the early and late 16th century. His paintings carried forward the vibrant, colorful palette; elegant and monumental figures; and energetic compositions of his stylistic origins in the Florentine circle of Andrea del Sarto, Jacopo Pontormo, and Agnolo Bronzino.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/269805/madonna-and-child-with-saints-elizabeth-and-john-the-baptist

Painstakingly modeled with fine lines of black chalk, the dynamic, muscular figure of the angel recalls Michelangelo’s monumental nudes created earlier in the century, while the androgynous features of his face are typical of the elegant style favored in the late 1500s. Considered a child prodigy by his contemporaries, Giuseppe Cesari became the head of the artists’ academy in Rome at the young age of 31. His busy workshop was a training ground for numerous pupils, the most notable of which was perhaps Caravaggio.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/262227/an-angel-in-flight

The drawing’s most finished side is divided into three scenes. The dead Christ is mourned by his followers at center. His tomb is prepared for his burial at left, and the bodies of the good and bad thieves—the two thieves who were crucified alongside Christ—are carried away at upper right. The sheet’s less-finished side contains a variation on the lamentation scene on the drawing’s front.Although he was influenced by his master, Raphael, Polidoro later adopted a style of drawing in pen and ink characterized by reduced forms made of agitated strokes and rapid hatching, as seen here.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/244909/the-lamentation-of-christ-recto-and-verso

The same was true in ancient Rome, which began producing its first coinage in the late 4th century BCE. Early coins depicted the heads of gods and goddesses on the front side, often in profile, while the back depicted animals, natural resources, symbols, and references to historical events. The denarius, introduced in 211 BCE, was the principal silver coin of Rome for five hundred years. The profile head of the goddess Roma—the personification of Rome—was the most popular image depicted on silver denarii in the second and first centuries BCE.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/9965/denarius-coin-depicting-the-goddess-roma

The mosaic pattern was made by sagging molten glass into bowl-shaped molds, a technique used on many of these fragments is similar to millefiori, “thousand flowers” in Italian, a modern glass-making method in which tiny rods of colored glass are bundled together, wrapped in a sheet of glass, fused, and then thinly sliced to reveal swirls of a flower-like patterns.

In true Renaissance form, the artists infused every inch of the image with a theatrical blend of mythology and antique ornament. Cupids gleefully urinate into one another’s vases in one of Giovanni Antonio’s columns, while half-armors and the spoils of war depicted throughout reinforce the Roman love of ancient history. The masked and hybrid creatures likely derive from grotteschi designs in Emperor Nero’s sunken Domus Aurea in Rome, which had been rediscovered and excavated in the decades before these prints were made.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/23434/triton-and-two-infant-satyrs-plate-four-from-twelve-ornament-panels

Cantarini likely completed this print while under the tutelage in Mantua of his mentor, Guido Reni (Italian, 1575–1642). Reni was widely known for his painting of Fortune, and several etchings, including this one, were made after its likeness. But the two artists later grew estranged.

itl_4319,Luigi Ghirri,Chromogenic print,Lucerna,"Following the worldwide upheavals of 1968, many artists began to doubt the efficacy of formal and aesthetic gestures unconnected to cultural resistance. Acutely aware of photography’s conventional use as propaganda to reinforce the standing order, Luigi Ghirri produced work that made commercial or mass-produced imagery appear in an ironic or diminished light. In Ghirri’s view, the Italian landscape appeared as a set of stock images, Technicolor hues, and cinematic montages. To make Lucerna, a very early work, he photographed the superimposition of two ready-made images in a plate glass window: the reflection of a car seen behind a photographic reproduction of a man in a tuxedo. Lucerna exemplifies Ghirri’s belief that “the autonomy of the photographic idiom” was “not being mere duplication and not being a simple chronometer of the eye to freeze the physical world.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/203584/lucerna

Following in Niépce’s experimental footsteps, Gioli tested the constraints of mass-produced instant film, peeling apart the freshly exposed negative while it was still developing and making multiple transfers of the diffusing dyes. He altered the transfers further with masks (strings or fabrics placed between the paper and the negative to block dye transfer), pencils, and tapes. Like specimens from the dawn of photography, the resulting unique artworks defy common conceptions of photography—and also call for cautious handling and exhibition.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/100941/untitled-from-the-series-homage-to-niepce
