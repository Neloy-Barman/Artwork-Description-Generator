usa_1,Alma Thomas,Acrylic on canvas,Starry Night and the Astronauts,"After decades as a representational painter, in her seventies Alma Thomas turned to abstraction, creating shimmering, mosaic-like fields of color with rhythmic dabs of paint that were often inspired by forms from nature. The artist had been fascinated with space exploration since the late 1960s, and her later paintings often referenced America’s manned Apollo missions to the moon. Although she had never flown, Thomas began to paint as if she were in an airplane, capturing what she described as shifting patterns of light and streaks of color. “You look down on things,” she explained. “You streak through the clouds so fast… . You see only streaks of color.”Starry Night and the Astronauts evokes the open expanse and celestial patterns of a night sky, but despite its narrative title, the work could also be read as an aerial view of a watery surface, playing with our sense of immersion within an otherwise flat picture plane. The viewer is immersed not only in the sense of organic expanse that this painting achieves, however, but also in an encounter with Thomas’s process: the surface here is clearly constructed stroke by stroke. Meanwhile, the glimpses of raw canvas between each primary-colored mark seem as vivid as the applied paint itself—almost as if the composition were backlit. Thomas relied on the enlivening properties of color throughout her late-blooming career. “Color is life,” she once proclaimed, “and light is the mother of color.” This painting was created in 1972, when the artist was eighty. In the same year, she became the first African American woman to receive a solo exhibition at a major art museum, the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/129884/starry-night-and-the-astronauts
usa_2,Kerry James Marshall,Acrylic on paper mounted on canvas,Many Mansions,"Many Mansions is the first in Kerry James Marshall’s series of five large-scale paintings depicting public housing projects in Chicago and Los Angeles such as Rockwell Gardens, Wentworth Gardens, or, as in Many Mansions, Stateway Gardens. Struck by the absurdity of the term “garden” to describe these failed solutions to low-income housing, Marshall was inspired to represent the profound contradictions of living in such an environment. Many Mansions is filled with ironic and startling juxtapositions of the real and artificial—from the unnaturally cheerful landscape to the three haunting, ebony-skinned figures dressed in nostalgic Sunday best. The title of the painting, visible on the red ribbon above, is a variation on Christ’s oft-quoted remark found in John [14:2]: “In my Father’s house there are many mansions.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/137125/many-mansions
usa_3,Joan Mitchell,Oil on linen,City Landscape,"Although influenced by Abstract Expressionist artists in New York in the early 1950s, Joan Mitchell did not prioritize self-expression: her often exuberant abstractions were “about landscape, not about me,” she once explained. Mitchell painted large, light-filled canvases animated by loosely applied skeins of bright color—here infused with the energy of a large metropolis.The title suggests a relationship between the painting’s network of pigments and the nerves or arteries of an urban space. The sense of spontaneity conveyed in City Landscape, however, belies Mitchell’s methods. Unlike many of her contemporaries, who were dubbed “action painters,” Mitchell worked slowly and deliberately. “I paint a little,” she said. “Then I sit and look at the painting, sometimes for hours. Eventually, the painting tells me what to do.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/86385/city-landscape
usa_4,Richard Hunt,Steel,Hero Construction,"Richard Hunt created Hero Construction in 1958, one year after graduating from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. The sculpture is composed of found objects—old pipes, bits of metal, and automobile parts—that the artist discovered in junkyards and on the street. Using a torch like a paintbrush, Hunt welded these elements into a form that is abstract yet recognizable.Hunt was fascinated with mythology, and Hero Construction can be related to other sculptures past and present, from ancient statues of Greek heroes to modern monuments of statesmen. The modest but monumental stance of the figure suggests a contemporary hero who maintains strength in the face of the uncertainties and dangers of the present age.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/8633/hero-construction
usa_5,Edward Hopper,Oil on canvas,Nighthawks,"About Nighthawks Edward Hopper recollected, “unconsciously, probably, I was painting the loneliness of a large city.” In an all-night diner, three customers sit at the counter opposite a server, each appear to be lost in thought and disengaged from one another. The composition is tightly organized and spare in details: there is no entrance to the establishment, no debris on the streets. Through harmonious geometric forms and the glow of the diner’s electric lighting, Hopper created a serene, beautiful, yet enigmatic scene. Although inspired by a restaurant Hopper had seen on Greenwich Avenue in New York, the painting is not a realistic transcription of an actual place. As viewers, we are left to wonder about the figures, their relationships, and this imagined world.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/111628/nighthawks
usa_6,Georgia O'Keeffe,Oil on canvas,Blue and Green Music,"Around 1920 Georgia O’Keeffe painted a number of oils exploring, as she later recalled, “the idea that music could be translated into something for the eye.” In Blue and Green Music, O’Keeffe’s colors and forms simultaneously suggest the natural world and evoke the experience of sound. She was drawn to the theories of the Russian Expressionist painter Vasily Kandinsky, who, in his 1912 text Concerning the Spiritual in Art, argued that visual artists should emulate music in order to achieve pure expression free of literary references.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/24306/blue-and-green-music
usa_7,Grant Wood,Oil on Beaver Board,American Gothic,"In American Gothic, Grant Wood directly evoked images of an earlier generation by featuring a farmer and his daughter posed stiffly and dressed as if they were, as the artist put it, “tintypes from my old family album.” They stand outside of their home, built in an 1880s style known as Carpenter Gothic. Wood had seen a similar farmhouse during a visit to Eldon, Iowa.When it was exhibited at the Art Institute in 1930, the painting became an instant sensation, its ambiguity prompting viewers to speculate about the figures and their story. Many understood the work to be a satirical comment on midwesterners out of step with a modernizing world. Yet Wood intended it to convey a positive image of rural American values, offering a vision of reassurance at the beginning of the Great Depression.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/6565/american-gothic
usa_8,Willem de Kooning,Oil on canvas,Excavation,"Willem de Kooning was a central figure in Abstract Expressionism, an art movement that espoused the painterly actions of the artist as a sign of his or her emotions. De Kooning completed Excavation in June 1950, just in time for it to be exhibited in the twenty-fifth Venice Biennale. His largest painting up to that date, the work exemplifies the Dutch-born innovator’s style, with its expressive brushwork and distinctive organization of space into sliding planes with open contours. According to the artist, the point of departure for the painting was an image of women working in a rice field in Bitter Rice, a 1949 Neorealist film by Italian director Giuseppe de Santis. The mobile structure of hooked calligraphic lines defines anatomical parts—bird and fish shapes, human noses, eyes, teeth, necks, and jaws—that seem to dance across the painted surface, revealing the particular tension between abstraction and figuration that is inherent in de Kooning’s work. The original white pigment has yellowed over the years, diluting somewhat the flashes of red, blue, yellow, and pink that punctuate the composition. Aptly titled, the painting reflects de Kooning’s technically masterful painting process: an intensive building up of the surface and scraping down of its paint layers, often for months, until the desired effect was achieved.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/76244/excavation
usa_9,Georgia O'Keeffe,Oil on canvas,Cow’s Skull with Calico Roses,"Georgia O’Keeffe collected this cow’s skull in New Mexico during the summer of 1930, when a drought had devastated the Southwest, and many animal skeletons could be found in the desert. She was captivated by the stark elegance of the bones and shipped some back to New York so she could paint them the following year. She noted, “To me they are as beautiful as anything I know… . The bones seem to cut sharply to the center of something that is keenly alive on the desert.” O’Keeffe’s inclusion of the calico fabric roses—which were used to decorate graves in New Mexico—further evokes questions of life, death, and mortality.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/61428/cow-s-skull-with-calico-roses
usa_10,Georgia O'Keeffe,Oil on canvas,Sky above Clouds IV,"Painted in the summer of 1965, when Georgia O’Keeffe was 77 years old, this monumental work culminates a series inspired by the artist’s experiences as an airplane passenger during the 1950s. Working in Abiquiu, New Mexico, O’Keeffe began around 1963 to capture the endless expanses of clouds she had observed from airplane windows during trips all over the world. Beginning with a relatively realistic depiction of small white clouds on a three-by-four-foot canvas, she progressed to more stylized images of the motif on larger surfaces. O’Keeffe wrote:“I painted a painting eight feet high and twenty-four feet wide—it kept me working every minute from six a.m. till eight or nine at night as I had to be finished before it was cold—I worked in the garage and it had no heat—Such a size is of course ridiculous but I had it in my head as something I wanted to do for a couple of years.”In 1970 Sky above Clouds IV was scheduled to be included in a retrospective of O’Keeffe’s work at the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the San Francisco Museum of Art. After being shown in New York and Chicago, the painting was determined to be too large to enter the doors of the museum in San Francisco. It thus remained on loan to the Art Institute for more than a decade, while the artist and public-minded collectors of her art arranged for it to join the museum’s permanent collection.The special relationship between O’Keeffe and the Art Institute began in 1905, when she enrolled as a student at the School of the Art Institute. Her first museum retrospective was organized here in 1943. Later, as the executor for the estate of her husband, the pioneering American photographer and art dealer Alfred Stieglitz, O’Keeffe presented the Art Institute with an important group of modernist works, including a number of her own, many of which are on view in the galleries of American art. She continued to make significant additions to this bequest until her death, at age 98, in 1986.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/100858/sky-above-clouds-iv
usa_11,Andy Warhol,"Acrylic, silkscreen ink, and pencil on linen",Mao,"The most influential of Pop artists, Andy Warhol cast a cool, ironic light on the pervasiveness of commercial culture and contemporary celebrity worship. Early in his career, he began to utilize the silk-screen process to transfer photographed images to canvas, creating multiple portraits of celebrities including Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, and Jacqueline Kennedy, as well as duplicated images of mass-produced products such as Campbell’s soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles. In this example from his Mao series, Warhol melded his signature style with the scale of totalitarian propaganda to address the cult of personality surrounding the Chinese ruler Mao Zedong (1893–1976). Nearly fifteen feet tall, this towering work mimics the representations of the political figure that were ubiquitously displayed throughout China. Warhol’s looming portrait impresses us with the duality of its realistic qualities and its plastic artificiality. In contrast to the photographic nature of the image, garish colors are applied to Mao’s face like makeup. The gestural handling of color in the portrait shows Warhol at his most painterly.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/47149/mao
usa_12,Peter Blume,Oil on canvas,The Rock,"A startling juxtaposition of images, The Rock depicts a shattered red rock resting on top of a base that is being demolished by workers below. Peter Blume labored for years to complete this painting, which was commissioned in 1939 by the Edgar Kaufmann family for Fallingwater, their Frank Lloyd Wright–designed home in Pennsylvania. Although the complex imagery resists easy interpretation, it may point to devastation and reconstruction, reflecting the turbulence of World War II and its aftermath. In the end, The Rock proved too large for Fallingwater and it was never displayed there.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/56682/the-rock
usa_13,Jackson Pollock,Oil on linen,Greyed Rainbow,"In the late 1940s Jackson Pollock developed a revolutionary form of Abstract Expressionism by dripping, pouring, and splashing paint onto large-scale canvases. Pollock emphasized the expressive power of the artist’s gestures, materials, and tools, often applying paint with sticks, trowels, and palette knives instead of brushes. He also challenged the concept of easel painting by working on canvases placed either on the floor or fixed to a wall. With no apparent beginning or end, top or bottom, his paintings imply an extension of his art beyond the edges of the canvas, engulfing the viewer. Among the last great purely abstract paintings Pollock made before his untimely death in 1956, Greyed Rainbow is a quintessential example of action painting. The paint application ranges from thick chunks squeezed directly from a tube to thin, meandering lines poured from a container with a small hole or squirted from a baster. The work is predominantly black, white, gray, and silver; in the bottom third of the canvas, however, Pollock thinly concealed orange, yellow, green, blue, and violet. The title of the work presumably refers to these grayed sections of hidden color.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/83642/greyed-rainbow
usa_14,Ivan Albright,Oil on canvas,That Which I Should Have Done I Did Not Do (The Door),"Replete with powerful imagery and bearing a long, philosophical title, That Which I Should Have Done I Did Not Do (The Door) is an evocative meditation on the choices and regrets in life. Ivan Albright considered The Door to be his most important picture, and he worked for ten years to achieve its mesmerizing effect. He spent weeks collecting props for the painting: a marred Victorian door found in a junkyard, a faded wax funeral wreath, and a tombstone for the doorsill. Once he arranged these objects, Albright completed an elaborate charcoal underdrawing that he then covered with the intricate and obsessively painted detail that characterizes most of his work. He would often finish no more than a quarter of a square inch a day. A wrinkled, aging woman’s hand rests on the carved doorway, a faded blue handkerchief clenched between the fingers. The poignant placement of the hand, near but not touching the doorknob, only underscores the sense of remorse and mourning implied by the painting. With its profound themes of mortality and the passage of time, The Door is a modern memento mori that encourages a consideration of the brevity of human existence.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/83905/that-which-i-should-have-done-i-did-not-do-the-door
usa_15,Bruce Nauman,"Four-channel video installation with 2 projections and 4 monitors, color, sound; approx. one hour",Clown Torture,"Bruce Nauman’s wildly influential, relentlessly imitated work explores the poetics of confusion, anxiety, boredom, entrapment, and failure. One of the artist’s most spectacular achievements to date, Clown Torture consists of two rectangular pedestals, each supporting two pairs of stacked color monitors; two large color-video projections on two facing walls; and sound from all six video displays. The monitors play four narrative sequences in perpetual loops, each chronicling an absurd misadventure of a clown (played to brilliant effect by the actor Walter Stevens). In “No, No, No, No (Walter),” the clown incessantly screams the word no while jumping, kicking, or lying down; in “Clown with Goldfish,” the clown struggles to balance a fish bowl on the ceiling with the handle of a broom; in “Clown with Water Bucket,” the clown repeatedly opens a door booby-trapped with a bucket of water that falls on his head; and finally, in “Pete and Repeat,” the clown succumbs to the terror of a seemingly inescapable nursery rhyme. The simultaneous presentation and the relentless repetition creates an almost painful sensory overload. With both clown and viewer locked in an endless loop of failure and degradation, the humor soon turns to horror.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/146989/clown-torture
usa_16,Ivan Albright,Oil on canvas,Into the World There Came a Soul Called Ida,"Holding a mirror, powdering her chest, and surrounded with accoutrements of fashion and beauty, the figure portrayed here does not necessarily inspire thoughts of youth and vibrancy. Rather, as one critic put it when this painting was first exhibited, he saw a “woman with flesh the color of a corpse drowned six weeks.” Ida Rogers herself was 19 years old at the time she posed for the artist. With his hyperbolic version of realism, Ivan Albright laboriously transformed his sitter into a vision of his own making. The painting is less a portrait than a meticulous musing on the passage of time and the relationship—both powerful and fragile—between mind and body.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/93811/into-the-world-there-came-a-soul-called-ida
usa_17,Narcissa Niblack Thorne (Designer),"Miniature room, mixed media","E-10: English Dining Room of the Georgian Period, 1770-90","The sixty-eight fascinating Thorne Miniature Rooms feature highlights from the history of interior design and decorative arts from the thirteenth century to 1940. These enchanting miniature stage sets were conceived by Mrs. James Ward Thorne of Chicago and constructed between 1934 and 1940 by master craftsmen according to her exacting specifications, on a scale of one inch to one foot. The harmonious elegance seen here is based on two dining rooms designed by Robert Adam, the successful eighteenth-century London architect whose precise and delicate interpretation of the antique (stimulated by then-recent excavations at Herculaneum and Pompeii) dictated English taste for a quarter of a century. To insure perfect conformity, Adam undertook the entire design of a house and every detail of its interior, hiring cabinetmakers to execute furniture that blended Neoclassical elements with current English forms. Instead of using wood and wallpaper, Adam carved low-relief ornament in plaster against painted panels in the style of Roman stuccos, as seen in this dining room. His furniture was often gilded in the Continental fashion, as is the side table in this room. The landscape over the table, painted by one of the many artists that Mrs. Thorne commissioned for the project, is in the style of Claude Lorrain.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/43714/e-10-english-dining-room-of-the-georgian-period-1770-90
usa_18,Georgia O'Keeffe,Oil on canvas,"The Shelton with Sunspots, N.Y.","“I went out one morning to look at [the Shelton Hotel] and there was the optical illusion of a bite out of one side of the tower made by the sun, with sunspots against the building and against the sky,” said Georgia O’Keeffe, recalling the precise moment that inspired her to paint The Shelton with Sunspots. Although her depictions of flowers and the southwestern landscape are powerful and evocative, O’Keeffe painted a group of cityscapes in the 1920s that are no less intriguing. She married the photographer and dealer Alfred Stieglitz in 1924, and the following year they moved into the Shelton, a recently completed skyscraper. O’Keeffe was fascinated by the soaring height of the building and emphasized its majesty in this painting by rendering it from the street below. In the glaring light of the emerging sun, the building becomes an abstracted series of rectangles arranged in the center of the composition. Yet the hard edges of the Shelton are softened by the numerous circular sunspots and wavy, flowing lines of smoke and steam, suggesting that despite her urban subject matter, O’Keeffe nevertheless sought to unify man-made and organic forms, just as she would in her southwestern paintings such as Black Cross, New Mexico .",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/104031/the-shelton-with-sunspots-n-y
usa_19,Frank Lloyd Wright (Designer),Clear and colored leaded glass in oak frames,"Triptych Window from the Coonley Playhouse, Riverside, Illinois","This colorful, whimsical triptych window is from the Avery Coonley Playhouse, a small structure that Frank Lloyd Wright designed as an addition to the Coonleys’ suburban Chicago estate, which he had previously completed in 1908. Louis Sullivan’s foremost student, Wright continued his teacher’s search for an indigenous American architecture. Like Sullivan, Wright drew inspiration from nature and natural forms, and both men were pioneers of the Prairie School of architecture, characterized by low-slung, horizontal lines and rambling, open spaces that reflect the gently rolling landscape of the Midwest. Odes to the middle-class American family at the turn of the century, Wright’s residences are organic, designed not only to adapt to a family’s changing structure but also to contain the sense of a unified and harmonious whole. Every detail of the Coonley complex, like all of Wright’s projects, bore his personal imprint, down to the creation and placement of the furniture and the design of this window. Referencing such Americana as the flag and colored balloons, Wright explored the use of glass both as a transparent screen uniting exterior and interior and as a decorative element, the colors and design of which anticipate the later abstractions of Piet Mondrian.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/105203/triptych-window-from-the-coonley-playhouse-riverside-illinois
usa_20,Mark Rothko,Oil on canvas,"Untitled (Purple, White, and Red)","Untitled (Purple, White, and Red) follows the characteristic format of Mark Rothko’s mature work, in which stacked rectangles of color appear to float within the boundaries of the canvas. By directly staining the canvas with many thin washes of pigment and paying particular attention to the edges where the fields interact, he achieved the effect of light radiating from the image itself. This technique suited Rothko’s metaphysical aims: to offer painting as a doorway into purely spiritual realms, making it as immaterial and evocative as music, and to directly communicate the most essential, raw forms of human emotion.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/100472/untitled-purple-white-and-red
usa_21,Charles Ray,Cypress,Hinoki,"“Ten years ago, while driving up the central coast of California, I spotted a fallen tree in a meadow just off the highway. I was instantly drawn to it. It was not only a beautiful log, but to my eyes, it was perfectly embedded in the meadow where it had fallen decades earlier. Pressure from the weather, insects, ultraviolet radiation, and gravity were evident. Total collapse appeared to be no more than a handful of years away. I was inspired to make a sculpture and studied many other logs, but I realized that I was only interested in this particular one.At one point, I determined that its armature could be its pneuma, the Greek word for breath, wind, or life. Later, I considered making an inflatable sculpture but realized that the tailoring of the form would bring an unwanted complexity to the surface. It then struck me that the breath or life of the sculpture could be manifested in the very act of sculpting. Making a wood carving of the log by starting from the inside and working my way out would bring a trajectory of life and intentionality to this great fallen tree. With several friends, I transported the tree, cut apart by a chainsaw, back to my Los Angeles studio. Silicone molds were taken and a fiberglass version of the log was reconstructed. This was sent to Osaka, Japan, where master woodworker Yuboku Mukoyoshi and his apprentices carved my vision into reality using Japanese cypress (hinoki). I was drawn to the woodworkers because of their tradition of copying work that is beyond restoration. In Japan, when an old temple or Buddha can no longer be maintained, it is remade. I visited Japan often and had a difficult time bringing this work to completion and allowing it to go out into the world. When I asked Mr. Mukoyoshi about the wood and how it would behave over time, he told me that the wood would be fine for 400 years and then it would go into a crisis; after two hundred years of splitting and cracking, it would go into slow decline for another 400 years. I realized then that the wood, like the original log, had a life of its own, and I was finally able to let my project go and hopefully breathe life into the world that surrounds it.”— Charles Ray",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/189207/hinoki
usa_22,Eva Hesse,Acrylic on cloth over wood; acrylic on cord over steel tube,Hang Up,"Eva Hesse produced an extraordinarily original, influential body of work in her short career, pioneering the use of eccentric materials and idiosyncratic sculptural forms. Hesse considered Hang Up among her most important works because it was the first to achieve the level of “absurdity or extreme feeling” she intended. Produced at the height of Minimalism and the Pop Art movement but belonging to neither, the piece was fabricated by her friend the artist Sol LeWitt, and her husband, Tom Doyle, who wrapped the wood stretcher with bed sheets and attached the cord-covered steel tubing. Sealed with acrylic, the object is subtly shaded from pale to dark ash gray. It is an ironic sculpture about painting, privileging the medium’s marginal features: the frame and its hanging device, represented by the cord that protrudes awkwardly into the gallery. The title might be understood as a humorous instruction for the sculpture’s display but also acts on a more psychological level. Collapsing the space between the viewer and the artwork, Hang Up creates a sense of disorientation and toys with our ability to discern a clear demarcation between painting and sculpture.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/71396/hang-up
usa_23,Thomas Hart Benton,Oil on canvas,Cotton Pickers,"Thomas Hart Benton first saw laborers cultivating cotton on a trip to Georgia in the late 1920s, and he returned to the subject in this painting in 1945. In Cotton Pickers, the artist rendered the figures with a sinuous, curvilinear style to articulate the exertion of their movement along the landscape. Cotton sharecropping, a system of tenant farming that developed after the Civil War, allowed landowners to rent land to poor farmers in return for a portion of the crops. Because the practice kept agricultural workers impoverished, it became a symbol of a racially and economically unjust system. Benton’s vision of modernism was firmly rooted in figuration. He often explored themes of US history, centering African Americans in those shared narratives.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/217201/cotton-pickers
usa_24,Jasper Johns,Encaustic and newspaper on canvas,Target,"In the mid-1950s Jasper Johns was searching for a way to move beyond Abstract Expressionism. He took the radical step of destroying his previous work and began painting a set of motifs that included numbers, the American flag, and the alphabet. These instantly recognizable images allowed him to reintroduce subject matter into his work, freeing him to explore other painterly concerns. One of the found images that Johns employed was the target, and from 1955 to 1961 the artist produced several dozen paintings and drawings that explored this device.Initially, Johns chose a palette of primary colors, a preexisting schema as found as the image itself. The artist’s use of oil and encaustic (pigment mixed with hot wax) created a quick-drying medium that recorded each drag and drip of the brush in almost sculptural terms. Indeed, these gestural nods to his Abstract predecessors allowed him to investigate the subtle nuances between form and material. There also exists a tension between the idea of the representational (a target) and the notion of the abstract (the geometry of concentric circles).",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/229351/target
usa_25,Roy Lichtenstein,"Graphite and lithographic rubbing crayon pochoir, with scraping, on cream wove paper, fixed ",Alka Seltzer,"Roy Lichtenstein had been exhibiting in galleries for nearly ten years when, in 1961, he dramatically changed the course of his work. Prompted by the comic strips on his children’s gum wrappers, he began to create paintings based on cartoon images. The reductive style that soon emerged became his particular contribution to the idiom known as Pop Art. From around 1961 until 1968, the artist created a group of highly finished black-and-white drawings that demonstrate his subversive use of commercial illustration techniques. In Alka Seltzer, Lichtenstein exploited everyday practices of visual representation and magnified them, indicating the gas bubbles rising over the glass by meticulously scraping away extra spaces from a field of imitation hand-stenciled Benday dots. To signify the reflective surface of the glass, he drew flat black graphite shapes—a parody, like the dots, of the reductive, linecut effect of pulp advertising. The artist’s use of mechanical reproduction conventions served to unify his composition and produce movement and volume on a two-dimensional surface. Alka Seltzer is one of Lichtenstein’s watershed works because it shows the artist summing up his early graphic techniques and introducing what would become his most significant formal preoccupations in the years that followed.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/122054/alka-seltzer
usa_26,Albert Bierstadt,Oil on canvas,Mountain Brook,"Albert Bierstadt is best remembered for his paintings of the American West, but during his early career, the ambitious artist also created New England landscapes, particularly of the White Mountains, as seen here. When this painting was first exhibited in 1863, critics declared it Bierstadt’s “best work” and praised the artist’s deft contrast of “light and shade,” which brought a heightened realism to the image. Bierstadt’s affinity for the White Mountains mirrored a growing interest in the region as one of America’s premier tourist attractions. Photographs of the area from the 19th century suggest that Bierstadt utilized landscape elements from the Flume, a popular New Hampshire tourist site, in this imaginary composition.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/146701/mountain-brook
usa_27,Winslow Homer,"Transparent watercolor, with touches of opaque watercolor, rewetting, blotting and scraping, over graphite, on moderately thick, moderately textured (twill texture on verso), ivory wove paper","After the Hurricane, Bahamas","Revered as America’s master of watercolor, Winslow Homer did not begin working in the medium until the mature age of thirty-seven. As a watercolorist, Homer adapted his practice to the diverse locales he visited. His sojourns in the tropics took him to the Bahamas, Bermuda, Cuba, and various locations in Florida. In each new environment, the self-taught artist pushed the flexible medium in new directions as he applied his increasingly sophisticated understanding of color and light to a new set of atmospheric conditions. This compelling watercolor was painted during Homer’s second trip to the Bahamas in the winter of 1898–99. Depicting a luckless man washed up on the beach, surrounded by fragments of his shattered craft, the work demonstrates the artist’s fascination with the rapid and dangerous weather changes of the region. Here sunlight glints through gradually thinning storm clouds. Homer employed thickly applied opaque red and yellow pigments for the seaweed tossed on the sand, creating a contrast with the thin washes and fluid brushstrokes that he used to render the receding waves.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16776/after-the-hurricane-bahamas
usa_28,William James Glackens,Oil on canvas,At Mouquin’s,"In this vivid painting, William Glackens portrayed the members of his circle at their favorite meeting place, the New York restaurant Mouquin’s. Jeanne Mouquin, the proprietor’s wife, shares a drink with James B. Moore, a wealthy playboy and restaurateur, while the artist’s wife, Edith, and art critic Charles Fitzgerald are reflected in the mirror behind them. Glackens used vivid brushwork to describe Jeanne Mouquin’s dress, while depicting her with an intent gaze that imbues the scene with tension and mystery. By combining portraiture and everyday scenes, the artist helped usher in a mode of painting suited to the uncertainties and new social activities of modern urban life.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/15401/at-mouquin-s

The building was part of the industrial landscape in his hometown of Lancaster, Pennsylvania, which Demuth began depicting with increasing monumentality in the last years of his life. Although he presented the factory with no reference to the potentially detrimental effects of industrialization, the painting expresses some irony or ambivalence. Demuth drew the title from the last line of “The Star-Spangled Banner,” which was adopted as the United States national anthem the year he painted this work, thus implying that for many workers, the factory was the new “home of the brave.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/64276/and-the-home-of-the-brave
usa_30,Charles White,"Charcoal, Wolff's carbon drawing pencil, and graphite, with stumping and erasing on ivory wood pulp laminate board",Harvest Talk,"Charles White is recognized for the richness of his graphic work and his paintings, which typically depict aspects of the history, culture, and life of African Americans. A native of Chicago, White attended the School of the Art Institute, the Art Students League of New York, and later the Taller de Gráfica Popular in Mexico. Beginning in 1939, he was employed by the Federal Art Project of the Works Progress Administration.White’s father was a railroad and steel worker and his mother was a domestic worker; this inspired in White a deep respect for labor. Harvest Talk, one of six charcoal and carbon pencil drawings originally exhibited at ACA Galleries in New York in 1953, exemplifies the artist’s mature drawing style. Here his strong, assured manner, coupled with the heroic proportions of the figures and the emphasis on the large scythe (an emblem often associated with the Soviet Union)—as well as the social realist sensibilities that prevail throughout his oeuvre, his travels to the Soviet Union, and his writings for and affiliation with left-wing publications such as Masses and Mainstream, Freedomways, and the Daily Worker—suggest that Harvest Talk was inspired by socialist ideals. Like many of White’s works on paper, it conveys the power of a mural despite its relatively small format.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/111810/harvest-talk
usa_31,Winslow Homer,Oil on canvas,Croquet Scene,"One of America’s foremost painters, Winslow Homer began his career as an illustrator during the Civil War. In the late 1860s, he turned his acute observational and technical skills toward oil painting, depicting figures bathed in sunlight out-of-doors. These early paintings, often executed in series, feature scenes of upper-class leisure pursuits—in this case, women and men competing with one another in the popular sport of croquet, which had recently been introduced to the United States from the British Isles. In Croquet Scene, one of five paintings Homer completed on the subject, progress on “the grand round” seems fairly advanced. The crouching male figure positions the ball belonging to the woman dressed in red. She is about to croquet (or “send up the country”) another ball, probably belonging to the woman in the left foreground, who shields her eyes against the bright afternoon sun. Notable for its bold patterning, strong contours, and brilliant light effects, the painting epitomizes the spirit of a breezy summer afternoon.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/44018/croquet-scene
usa_32,Frederic Edwin Church,Oil on canvas,View of Cotopaxi,"View of Cotopaxi brings together in visual form scientific, religious, political, and cultural ideas in the mid-19th century. Inspired by German naturalist Alexander von Humboldt’s concept of ecological interconnectedness, Frederic Edwin Church traveled to South America to meticulously study the tropical landscape. The artist produced at least ten finished paintings of the Ecuadorian volcano, this one completed in his studio just before his second visit to the region. For Church and other Christian viewers, nature, with all its creative and destructive wonders, was evidence of divine power. The painting likewise reflected an imperialist vision, as US government officials eyed Latin America as a site for territorial expansion and conquest.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/76571/view-of-cotopaxi
usa_33,Eldzier Cortor,Oil and gesso on Masonite,The Room No. VI,"Eldzier Cortor painted The Room No. VI in Chicago, where he had grown up and trained as an artist. The work exposes the impoverished living conditions many African Americans experienced on the city’s South Side in the early decades of the 20th century. As a result of racial bias in housing, black residents were often forced to live in what were called “kitchenettes,” namely, apartments subdivided into one-room spaces with limited access to kitchens or bathrooms. The nude woman anchoring the composition is flanked by three other individuals, whose cropped bodies extend across a single mattress. The artist emphasized pattern and texture, particularly the shapes and brilliant colors of the bed linens, floorboards, and wallpaper. Cortor’s deliberately decorative vocabulary recasts the scene’s bleak circumstances into a dynamic, luminous composition.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/191556/the-room-no-vi
usa_34,Stuart Davis,Oil on canvas,Ready-to-Wear,"The title of this vibrant painting refers to the American invention of mass produced, or “ready-to-wear,” clothing, a term first employed in an 1895 Montgomery Ward catalog. Stuart Davis looked to the sights and sounds of popular culture throughout his successful career, excited by innovations he saw in advertising, industry, and jazz music. Here, the broad, flattened areas of red, white, black, and blue may represent leftover pieces of fabric, while the angular white shape in the upper-right corner evokes a pair of scissors. With its bright palette and energetic composition, the painting celebrates not only the vitality of the ready-to-wear clothing industry but also, Davis suggested, America itself.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/2189/ready-to-wear
usa_35,Bruce Nauman,Neon tubing with clear glass tubing suspension frames,Human Nature/Life Death,"Regarded as one of the most innovative artists of his generation, Bruce Nauman has produced an oeuvre of stunning diversity, encompassing works of film, installation, performance, photography, sculpture, and video. He creates profoundly aesthetic experiences that are often aimed at disrupting viewers’ habits of perception. In the mid-1960s the artist adopted the medium of flashing neon in order to critically examine the role of language in visual art. Inspired by its hypnotic aura and non-art aesthetic, Nauman began using this quintessentially commercial medium in an ironic way, as a vehicle for wordplay, puns, and jokes. The artist created this neon sign for an invitational sculpture exhibition held in Chicago in 1985. Three pairs of words, antithetical in their connotations, line the six-foot circumference: life and death, love and hate, and pleasure and pain. In the center, human, animal, and nature are repeated in stacked sets of two. Each word blinks independently, ordered so that over several minutes all possible permutations are displayed. Juxtapositions of colors produce optical illusions that create a jarring, visceral effect. This work ultimately insists on language’s inability to deliver a fixed or stable set of meanings, conveying a deep suspicion about what constitutes truth, especially in the public realm.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/147513/human-nature-life-death
usa_36,Samuel J. Miller,Daguerreotype,Frederick Douglass,"In 1839 Louis-Jacques-Mandé Daguerre announced the perfection of the daguerreotype, a photographic process that employed a silver-coated copperplate sensitive to light. This new artistic process was celebrated for its remarkably sharp detail and praised as a “democratic art” that brought portraiture into reach for the masses. Within a few years, thousands of daguerrean portrait studios had sprung up all over the United States, among them the one that Samuel J. Miller owned in Akron, Ohio. Although most of the likenesses made in commercial studios were formulaic and not very revealing of the subject’s character, this portrait of Frederick Douglass—an escaped slave who had become a lauded speaker, writer, and abolitionist agitator—is a striking exception. Northeastern Ohio was a center of abolitionism prior to the Civil War, and Douglass knew that this picture, one of an astonishing number that he commissioned or posed for, would be seen by ardent supporters of his campaign to end slavery. Douglass was an intelligent manager of his public image and likely guided Miller in projecting his intensity and sheer force of character. As a result, this portrait demonstrates that Douglass truly appeared “majestic in his wrath,” as the nineteenth-century feminist Elizabeth Cady Stanton observed.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/145681/frederick-douglass
usa_37,Jacob Lawrence,Egg tempera on hardboard,The Wedding,"“I paint the things I have experienced,” Jacob Lawrence once said. In The Wedding, Lawrence depicted both the solemnity and the joy of a marriage ceremony and the coming together of families. Positioning the figures with their backs to the viewer, Lawrence’s composition invites us to participate in the couple’s major life event. Although the preacher’s face is only partially defined, he appears to look down with great seriousness as the two contemplate their vows. The large, colorful urns overflowing with flowers signify happiness and may also represent the future prosperity of this union.Lawrence depicted the histories and events of black Americans—whether through individual compositions such as The Wedding that commemorated the everyday activities of his fellow Harlem residents, or through series of paintings that explored subjects ranging from the Great Migration to the story of Harriet Tubman.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/125660/the-wedding
usa_38,Leon Golub,Acrylic on canvas,Interrogation II,"A leading cultural and civil rights activist in the United States from the early 1960s until his death in 2004, Leon Golub consistently created works that addressed humanitarian issues. This piece belongs to a series of paintings that deals with human rights violations in Central America. By fixing the gaze of his grinning perpetrators directly on the viewer, Golub makes it difficult to look away. The artist thus compels viewers to examine their own relationship to the brutality depicted.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/100250/interrogation-ii
usa_39,Roy Lichtenstein,Oil and magna on canvas,Brushstroke with Spatter,"Roy Lichtenstein rose to prominence at the beginning of the 1960s and became one of the best-known practitioners of Pop Art. His brightly painted canvases depicting everyday objects, as well as scenes of war and romance culled from the pages of contemporary comics, were rendered in stylized black outlines and hand-painted Ben Day dots that mimicked the commercial printing process. Thus he seemed to elevate what was often seen as low art—both its quotidian, affective subject matter and its visual terms—into high art. This was never simply a straightforward process of reversal, however, and by mid-decade Lichtenstein began to focus on subjects that reflected his lifelong interest in art historical themes.Brushstroke with Spatter, from the Brushstroke series (1965–67), is a wry commentary on the bravura of midcentury Abstract Expressionism. Here Lichtenstein combines the gestural sweep of Willem de Kooning’s brushwork with the rhythmic drips typical of Jackson Pollock. He isolates and magnifies his stroke and spatter against a ground of Ben Day dots, reproducing the conventionally painterly elements as flatly as possible with no trace of emotion or texture. This deadpan rendering is not purely comic, but also establishes a tension key to the work’s success as an abstract painting in its own right, with grand scalar play and dramatic cropping, intensity of color, and the optical pulse of the dotted ground.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/24836/brushstroke-with-spatter
usa_40,Cy Twombly,"Oil paint, lead pencil, wax crayon, colored pencil on canvas",The First Part of the Return from Parnassus,"Cy Twombly’s famously inimitable art is tensely balanced between expressively abstract and suggestively pictorial impulses. His work originated under the auspices of Abstract Expressionism in the late 1940s and early 1950s and advanced uniquely along lines afforded by its freedoms. Twombly’s entire enterprise is characterized by unruly marks—stammering, energetic, and raw—that merge drawing, painting, writing, and symbolic glyphs. Scrawled, overwritten, erased, or willfully misspelled, words cite people, places, events, and stories nominally derived from Greco-Roman culture and history, especially literature, poetry, and myth.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/186049/the-first-part-of-the-return-from-parnassus
usa_41,Walter Ellison,Oil on cardboard,Train Station,"Walter Ellison’s energetic scene of travelers departing a terminal for numerous destinations foregrounds the harsh realities of racial injustice under Jim Crow in the 1930s. On the left, white passengers, assisted by black porters, embark on vacations to Florida on southbound trains. On the right, black passengers board train cars heading north to Chicago, Detroit, and New York in search of work and opportunities for better lives.By inscribing his initials, W. W. E., on a suitcase at lower right, the artist personalized this symbolic vision of relocation, loss, and hope. Born in Georgia, he was among the more than six million African Americans who joined the Great Migration from the rural South to the urban North, moving to Chicago by 1926. Ellison studied briefly at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in the 1930s.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/105800/train-station
usa_42,Charles Sheeler,Oil on canvas,The Artist Looks at Nature,"The Artist Looks at Nature presents an imagined scene of rolling greenery, massive stone walls, stairs, and pathways. Contrary to its title, the artist, Charles Sheeler, depicted himself seated at an easel, ignoring the brightly lit landscape in front of him. Rather, the figure works intently on a monochromatic drawing of an antiquated stove, which is based on one of Sheeler’s own photographs from 1917. The self-portrait also relies upon an earlier photograph by the artist.Here, Sheeler engaged in reconstructing his own artistic past—looking back at his work across media and reconfiguring it into something new and surreal in the present. Although the painting’s intent remains unknown, it is clear that Sheeler, as artist, catalyzed and shaped this visual journey.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/49714/the-artist-looks-at-nature
usa_43,Ellsworth Kelly,Oil on canvas; 7 joined panels,Red Yellow Blue White and Black II,"Red Yellow Blue White and Black II is an early example of Kelly’s multipanel paintings. While living in Europe between 1948 and 1954, the artist encountered winged altarpieces in churches and cathedrals, which sparked his interest in works composed of separate pieces. He began arranging the colors of his paintings using chance techniques, removing himself from decisions that would influence the aesthetic of the finished artwork. Rather than use handmade marks in this piece, Kelly relied on intersecting edges and flat planes of monochrome color to express form.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/157156/red-yellow-blue-white-and-black-ii
usa_44,Philip Guston,Oil on canvas,Couple in Bed,"An established painter of some of the most poetic Abstract Expressionist painting of the late 1950s, Guston gradually abandoned abstraction in the 1960s in favor of seemingly crude, cartoonish, images drawn from memory. In Couple in Bed, Guston lays in bed with his wife, Musa, their faces pressed together as one in the manner of Brancusi’s The Kiss. Here the artist holds his brushes as tightly as he does his wife, who in May of 1977 suffered a series of debilitating strokes.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/90583/couple-in-bed
usa_45,Horace Pippin,Oil on cotton mounted on Masonite,Cabin in the Cotton,"Constructed of dense, thick layers of paint, Cabin in the Cotton exemplifies the tactile and vivid style of selftaught artist Horace Pippin. At a southern homestead, an older woman cares for a young child. Beyond, an expansive field of cotton evokes the hard labor, likely that of family members, required to harvest the crop. Pippin turned to painting as a mode of rehabilitation after injuring his arm while serving in World War I. Born in Pennsylvania, the artist’s interpretation of cotton fields drew upon a visit to South Carolina with his regiment in 1917. Popular culture also may have informed his work: “Cabin in the Cotton” was the title of both a song and a film in the 1930s. On view in a shoe repair shop outside Philadelphia in 1937, the composition caught the attention of artists, critics, and gallerists, winning Pippin wide acclaim and furthering his career.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/111617/cabin-in-the-cotton
usa_46,Robert Gober,"Silk satin, muslin, linen, tulle, welded steel, hand-printed silkscreen on paper, cast hydrostone plaster, vinyl acrylic paint, ink, and graphite",Untitled,"Robert Gober’s insistently handmade, deceptively modest sculptures are re-creations of familiar things—body parts and everyday objects such as children’s furniture, sinks, and urinals. As imitations of the originals, Gober’s works have an uncanny effect, triggering disquieting thoughts about the most commonplace aspects of daily life. At the Paula Cooper Gallery in New York in 1989, Gober constructed two three-sided rooms defined by temporary sheetrock walls. The room seen here was outfitted with wallpaper depicting alternating images of a sleeping white man and a lynched black man hanging from a tree. At the literal center of the installation, the figure of a bride is strongly conjured by a wedding dress supported by a welded steel armature. The delicate dress stands rigid and empty, waiting to be filled. Gober himself has speculated that the relationship between the bride and the sleeping man in the wallpaper is that of husband and wife. Eight hand-painted plaster bags of cat litter line the walls of the room. A material that absorbs or hides waste, the litter serves as a symbolic remedy for the figurative mess of the bride, groom, and murdered black man. More to the point, however, it speaks to the lasting obligations and intimacy of committed love. On the whole, the room—and the veiled story of the imaginary couple it contains—can be considered a meditation on gender, race, romance, and terrible violence in contemporary American life.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/192689/untitled
usa_47,George Inness,Oil on canvas,"Early Morning, Tarpon Springs","In 1878 the painter George Inness wrote in Harper’s magazine:“Details in the pictures must be elaborated only enough fully to reproduce the impression that the artist wishes to reproduce. When [there are more details], the impression is weakened or lost, and we see simply an array of external things which may be cleverly painted and may look very real, but which do not make an artistic painting… . The one is poetic truth, the other is scientific truth; the former is aesthetic, the latter is analytic.”In the course of his lengthy career, Inness increasingly eschewed precision of detail in his paintings, conveying mood and emotion through richness of tone and broadness of handling. He first visited Florida about 1890, and he subsequently established a house and studio in Tarpon Springs, where he executed this painting. In a pink-and-blue morning light, a lone man studies a cluster of buildings in the middle distance. Through blurred outlines and delicate, subtle tonalities, as well as the solitary presence of the figure, Inness masterfully evoked the brightening day and peaceful mood of this moment.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/64729/early-morning-tarpon-springs
usa_48,Lyonel Feininger,Oil on canvas,Carnival in Arcueil,"This is one of a group of recently rediscovered early masterpieces by Lyonel Feininger that had been left behind when the artist and his family were forced to leave Nazi Germany in 1937 for the United States. For over forty years, this group of roughly fifty pictures remained unknown and inaccessible in the East German home of the friend in whose custody Feininger had left them. Only after a prolonged legal battle were all but three of the pictures finally returned to the artist’s heirs in 1984 and exhibited as a group in 1985.This picture reveals an artist of remarkable maturity and vision, despite the fact that Feininger had not turned seriously to painting until 1907. It was only then that improved financial circumstances allowed him to give up his successful career as a cartoonist. The setting for this painting is the town of Arcueil, south of Paris, where Feininger spent several months a year from 1906 to 1912. Its majestic viaduct became a frequent subject in the artist’s drawings starting as early as 1908. His intense interest in architecture, which was to remain constant in Feininger’s work, is apparent here not only in the use of the viaduct but also in the brilliantly colored block of houses in the middle ground. It may have been reinforced at this time by his interest in Robert Delaunay’s work, in which architectural subjects likewise plays a primary role.Feininger’s early admiration for Vincent van Gogh seems evident in the heavily impastoed surface and in the use of highly saturated colors, especially yellow, which in the row of houses is beautifully modulated by touches of pink, green, and orange. Also reminiscent of van Gogh are the animated, billowing contours of the houses’ rooftops, which in turn echo the sweeping movement of the clouds. Against this dramatic backdrop, Feininger deployed a motley crew of grotesque and vaguely sinister characters, some of whom recall Feininger’s earlier cartoons. With their vividly colored costumes, these figures create a striking counterpoint to the dominant yellow of the background. But the ultimate impression is one of dissonance between the grandeur and beauty of the town’s architecture and the bombastic artificiality of its inhabitants.—Entry, Margherita Andreotti, Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies, Vol. 20, No. 2, The Joseph Winterbotham Collection at The Art Institute of Chicago (1994), p. 144-145.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/76240/carnival-in-arcueil
usa_49,William Michael Harnett,Oil on canvas,For Sunday’s Dinner,"Still-life painter William Michael Harnett excelled at trompe l’oeil, painting that fools the eye, through realistic depiction. In For Sunday’s Dinner, a chicken hangs in front of a painted door with its throat cut and most of its feathers plucked; a few remaining downy spots stand out against the puckered, pimpled flesh. The metal door hinges, on the right side of the canvas, frame the chicken and echo its form. The painting’s title and the rough, blemished surface of the door suggest a country dinner, the homey meal evoking nostalgia for a simpler past.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/111377/for-sunday-s-dinner
usa_50,Andy Warhol,Acrylic and silkscreen ink on linen,Liz #3 [Early Colored Liz],"Pop Art icon Andy Warhol’s embrace of mass culture radically altered the course of late twentieth-century art history, redefining both what a work of art can or should depict as well as the way in which it can be made. His breakthrough artistic moment came when he took the commercial printing process of photo-emulsion silkscreen and applied it to canvas. This allowed him to reproduce the same image over and over, quickly and efficiently.Warhol celebrated both products and personalities, giving equal weight to soup cans and movie stars. He began using images of Elizabeth Taylor in early 1962. Her beauty and allure fueled interest in the sordid tragedies of her personal life, which included failed marriages, love affairs, and a near-death experience that occurred while filming Cleopatra (1963). Liz #3 [Early Colored Liz] comes from a series of thirteen canvases, each with the same image of Taylor set before a jewel-toned background. Warhol used a preexisting publicity still of Taylor as his source material, which he cropped and then enlarged so that the actress literally fills the screen. Her signature features — her eyes and lips — have been accentuated with colors that hover between vibrant and vulgar. This garish use of “makeup” is meant to suggest style and glamor, reinforcing Taylor’s celebrity status.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/229406/liz-3-early-colored-liz
usa_51,Willem de Kooning,Pastel and charcoal on ivory wove paper,Two Women’s Torsos,"A pioneer of Abstract Expressionism, Willem de Kooning experimented with the human form throughout his career, which reached its apex in the early 1950s with his celebrated Woman series. Two Women’s Torsos was created during an intense campaign in which the artist focused on drawings related to his Woman paintings, which were exhibited together with this and other drawings at the Sidney Janis Gallery, New York, in 1953.De Kooning’s drawings are admired for their number and variety as well as for the artist’s expressive technique, exemplified here by his gestural use of pastel in concert with charcoal. This drawing’s velvety texture and almost violently animated surface are characteristic of the approximately one hundred sheets that remain from his intense work on the woman theme in 1952 and 1953. Also typical of de Kooning’s art is the way in which Two Women’s Torsos references aspects of related paintings but stands alone as an independent work. As the artist tried to jettison traditional modes of composition, he used drawing as a primary vehicle for the sequential development of his most important early body of work.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/83889/two-women-s-torsos
usa_52,Felix Gonzalez-Torres,Paint on wall,“Untitled”,"Felix Gonzalez-Torres’s work is consistently characterized by a sense of quiet elegy. One of the defining moments in his widely influential career, “Untitled” can be considered a self-portrait in the form of words and dates. First realized in 1989, the work expanded with subsequent installations until the artist’s premature death in 1996, and can continue to shift in ongoing manifestations. The portrait joins historical events and enigmatic personal milestones into a running text placed close to the ceiling. Such an installation is reminiscent of traditional friezes carved on the faces of public architecture, including the facade of the Art Institute’s 1893 Allerton Building, which includes artists’ names chiseled into a horizontal band. By offering clues to a personal history in a commemorative form normally dedicated to institutional use, Gonzalez-Torres undercuts the public and official in favor of the private and subjective, reminding us that an individual’s identity is not always reducible to an image captured on canvas or etched in marble. “Untitled” can change each time it is installed and may be presented in an infinite variety of ways. Its owner is obliged to consider adding (or subtracting) events, including ones subsequent to the artist’s death, ensuring that it remains relevant and dynamic.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/159824/untitled
usa_53,Arshile Gorky,Charcoal on ivory laid paper,The Artist’s Mother,"“The eyes of the Armenian speak before the lips move and long after they cease to,” Arshile Gorky once wrote. These words aptly describe this heroic portrait of the artist’s mother, Shushan der Marderosian. Although of noble lineage, Shushan and her family were peasants who faced poverty and Turkish persecution and massacre; in 1919 she died from starvation. The following year, Gorky and one of his sisters immigrated to the United States. This tender, haunting image is based on a photograph of the artist with his mother taken in 1912. Clad in simple country clothes, Shushan is a gaunt, distant figure with remarkable and piercing eyes. Gorky depicted his mother with careful, classical simplicity, transforming her dark beauty into the perfect features of an Orthodox church icon. The same photograph served as the inspiration for two canvases entitled The Artist and His Mother (1926–c. 1936; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; c. 1926–c. 1942; National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC), as well as numerous notebook sketches and other drawings, of which this is the most finished. From this early representational mode, Gorky’s art underwent a complex evolution that led, in the 1940s, to his dynamic, biomorphic abstractions. Tragically, the artist did not escape hardship. After a series of personal disasters in the 1940s, Gorky took his own life.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/23684/the-artist-s-mother
usa_54,John Quincy Adams Ward (Sculptor),Bronze,The Freedman,"A leader among the nation’s second generation of sculptors, John Quincy Adams Ward played a significant role in elevating the medium in the United States, calling for a new realism to address moral concerns. Inspired by Abraham Lincoln’s 1862–63 Emancipation Proclamation, The Freedman reflects not only Ward’s aspiration to create relevant statements on pressing issues of the day but also his abolitionist sentiments. Using antiquity as his inspiration, he depicted a seminude man seated on a tree stump who has just been liberated from the shackles that bound him to slavery. Ward broke artistic convention by showing the former enslaved person as master of his own destiny, not a man reliant on white men for freedom. The vestiges of chains, potent symbols of his bondage, dangle from both wrists, and his muscular body, turned to look over his shoulder, is contained within a formal, triangular composition. The Freedman was modeled from life and is generally considered among the first naturalistic sculptural representations of an African American. Shortly after The Freedman was first exhibited in 1863, art critic James Jackson Jarves effectively summarized the work’s power: “We have seen nothing in our sculpture more soul-lifting or more comprehensively eloquent. It tells in one word the whole sad story of slavery and the bright story of emancipation.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/149776/the-freedman
usa_55,Joseph Cornell,Box construction with painted glass,Untitled (Butterfly Habitat),"For approximately thirty years, Joseph Cornell worked in relative obscurity in the basement of his home in Queens, New York, creating a multitude of wondrous miniature worlds within his boxed constructions. Poetic mélanges of found objects and materials, his deeply personal and elusive work (which also includes many collages on paper) combines the enthusiasms of his childhood—butterflies, marbles, seashells, sky charts, stamps—with adult fascinations such as ballerinas, empty cages, and movie stars. Cornell’s boxes often prompt a dizzying series of associations; in Untitled (Butterfly Habitat), these include Christmas decorations, collector’s cabinets for specimens, microscopes, natural history displays, sailor’s boxes, and windows. Some of these references are contradictory, reinforcing the work’s ambiguity. Ideas linked to flight, voyages, and the exotic are countered by the rigid and symmetrical organization of the display. The butterflies are not, however, pinned as they would be on a specimen board. Each pane of paint-spattered glass encloses a small compartment with white wood walls in which a cutout of a paper butterfly is suspended with string, allowing for some movement as the box is handled.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/99766/untitled-butterfly-habitat
usa_56,Jasper Johns,Encaustic on canvas and wooden boards with objects,Near the Lagoon,"Jasper Johns has often afﬁxed objects to the surfaces of his paintings in an ongoing search for non-illusionistic ways of mediating between the ﬂat plane of the picture and a fully dimensional world. For his Catenary series (1997–2003), of which Near the Lagoon is the largest and last work, Johns formed catenaries—a term used to describe the curve assumed by a cord suspended freely from two points—by tacking ordinary household string to the canvas or its supports. In Near the Lagoon, the string activates and engages the abstract, collaged field of multitonal gray behind it, casting an actual shadow on the canvas, in addition to the painted ones that Johns rendered by hand; the string even creates a rut where the artist embedded it into and later pulled it out of the encaustic.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/184095/near-the-lagoon

Although Arthur Dove experimented early on with abstraction, in the 1920s he developed a unique representational style that simplified elements and toyed with scale to capture the fundamental forms and forces of nature. Dove was equally fascinated with the materials of art and here mixed metallic paint with something like wax to thicken its consistency.

usa_58,Roy Lichtenstein,Oil and Magna on two sets of three joined canvases,Mirror #3 (Six Panels),"Roy Lichtenstein was perhaps the most consistently inventive artist among the group of individuals who rose to prominence as the progenitors of American Pop Art in the early 1960s. Throughout his career, he explored the functional simplicity and visual clichés that characterize processes of mechanical reproduction. Initially preoccupied with the visual immediacy of cartoons, Lichtenstein embraced the technical constraints of graphic illustration, applying them to painting. Mirror #3 (Six Panels) is among the most ambitious, summarizing canvases in the artist’s Mirror series (1969–72). Like his famous cartoon images, these paintings were inspired by popular culture sources. Studying illustrations from furniture and glass-company catalogues, Lichtenstein familiarized himself with pictorial conventions used to represent reflection. The work also references the long tradition of rendering mirrors in art, a theme that was explored by artists from Diego Velázquez to Pablo Picasso. Lichtenstein was perhaps most invested, however, in broadly generic questions of surface and support. Only stylized gleam and shadow are reflected in his mirror; thus, the puzzling, fragmented, even conceptual abstraction becomes the real subject of the work.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/184362/mirror-3-six-panels
usa_59,Frederic Remington (Sculptor),Bronze with brown patina,The Bronco Buster,"A technical achievement in bronze, this composition of a cowboy attempting to tame a horse portrays an idea of the Western United States in dramatic and violent terms: white settler-colonialists in the act of subduing nature and flesh. As a painter and illustrator, Frederic Remington garnered success by crafting mythic, romanticized views of frontier life; The Bronco Buster was his first attempt to do so in sculpture. For white audiences living east of the Mississippi River at the turn of the 20th century, the artist’s triumphant figures came to represent a singular—and distorted—vision of an unfamiliar American West.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/97916/the-bronco-buster

Made on the eve of World War I, Movements possesses a turbulent energy that sparks associations with both the vibrancy of modern Berlin and movements of music. Like the Russian Expressionist painter Vasily Kandinsky, Hartley sought to make his work more like music, which he admired for its nonnarrative nature and its potential to be purely spiritual or separate from material reality.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/65916/movements
usa_61,Lawrence Weiner,Language + materials referred to,TAKEN FROM HERE TO WHERE IT CAME FROM AND TAKEN TO A PLACE AND USED IN SUCH A MANNER THAT IT CAN ONLY REMAIN AS A REPRESENTATION OF WHAT IT WAS WHERE IT CAME FROM,"Lawrence Weiner established himself as one of the leading figures in the Conceptual Art Movement during the late 1960s by creating works that challenge traditional assumptions about the nature of the art object. Using language as his medium, Weiner set out to question the conventional relationship between artist and viewer and to redefine standard systems of artistic display and distribution. In 1968 he issued a statement of intent, outlining the three conditions in which his works could exist: they could be built by him; fabricated by someone else; or not constructed at all. His works have the potential for being realized in countless ways and contexts; they may be shown outdoors as a public project, published in a book, printed on a matchbook cover, or simply spoken. He is best known, however, for written phrases presented on gallery or museum walls, typically in stenciled or vinyl lettering. Weiner felt the permanence and integrity of a linguistic construction, presented as a title in the form of a simple descriptive phrase on the wall, was less vulnerable to change over time than an actual sculpture. This work—which describes a physical act of displacement as a metaphor for representation—and its title are one and the same.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/107069/taken-from-here-to-where-it-came-from-and-taken-to-a-place-and-used-in-such-a-manner-that-it-can-only-remain-as-a-representation-of-what-it-was-where-it-came-from
usa_62,John Bradley Storrs,"Copper-alloy plated with nickel, then chrome",Ceres,"John Storrs was a leading American modernist sculptor in the 1920s and 1930s. Although he moved to Paris in 1911 and spent much of his career there, he grew up in Chicago and studied at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts and the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. Ceres is a smaller version of the figure Storrs designed for the top of the Chicago Board of Trade Building. In his efforts to make the sculpture symbolic of the building’s purpose, Storrs turned to the Classical subject of Ceres, the Roman goddess of grain, alluding to the board’s activity as the world’s biggest grain exchange. He depicted Ceres holding a sheaf of wheat in one hand and a grain sample bag in the other. Storrs also synchronized his sculpture with the building’s Art Deco architecture, emphasizing the figure’s streamlined form and employing modern materials. Ceres garnered a great deal of praise; a contemporary review stated that “this work has been described by some of the nation’s leading architects as one of the finest pieces of architectural sculpture to be found in America.” Perhaps in reaction to such favorable notices, Storrs produced smaller versions of the sculpture, such as this one.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/63178/ceres
usa_63,Vija Celmins,Alkyd on canvas mounted on aluminum,Night Sky #2,"In the mid-1960s Vija Celmins began using photographs from books, magazines, and newspapers that she found in secondhand stores and at yard sales as the point of departure for her paintings. While she produced work in the wake of Pop Art, her interest in the quotidian had nothing to do with issues of commerce or the media but rather with the illusionistic process of image making itself. Since the early 1970s, the artist has created exacting depictions of such expansive subjects as desert floors, ocean waves, the surface of the moon, and star-studded night skies—the latter derived from satellite photographs. To create her smooth, velvety compositions, Celmins often applies multiple layers of pigment to her canvases, sanding each down before she adds the next. Each work is further modulated through the use of a wide range of black, white, and silvery-gray tones. With its jewel-like imagery and suggestion of vastness, Night Sky #2 is at once romantic and unsettling. Lacking the anchor of a horizon, a humanly scaled reference point, or a recognizable landmark, viewers may have difficulty determining their relationship to the image. The enormity of the subject presented on a relatively small scale (the work is less than two feet wide) furthers this sense of disorientation.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/140645/night-sky-2
usa_64,Diane Arbus,Gelatin silver print,Two Ladies at the Automat (New York City),"Just two years before she received her first camera, Diane Arbus wrote: “There are and have been and will be an infinite number of things on Earth. Individuals all different, all wanting different things, all knowing different things, all loving different things, all looking different… . That is what I love: the differentness.” Arbus’s appreciation for the unusual, eccentric, and extraordinary led her to photograph a range of subjects over the thirty years of her career—transvestites, giants, art philanthropists, nudists, and, as here, similarly dressed and made-up women. These ladies, with their cigarettes poised in one hand and lighters clutched in the other, occupy a booth in a New York City automat. (Now nearly obsolete and a nostalgic choice even in the 1960s, automats offered simple fare, sold from coin-operated vending machines, that was eaten at surrounding booths and counters.) Like many of Arbus’s subjects, these women were photographed in a straightforward manner. The eerily matched ladies face the camera head-on, posed in front of an unadorned marble wall and staring directly at the viewer. The candor with which Arbus presented these women is typical of the pioneering, powerful first-person directness that exists throughout her photography.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/63234/two-ladies-at-the-automat-new-york-city
usa_65,Nan Goldin,Multimedia installation (720 color slides and programmed soundtrack),The Ballad of Sexual Dependency,"For thirty-five years Nan Goldin has obsessively recorded her life experiences, and her slide installation The Ballad of Sexual Dependency represents the zenith of this endeavor. A hybrid of photography, film, and installation art, the work projects hundreds of Goldin’s photographs in a unique sequence, accompanied by a specified soundtrack. Images representing couples, gender roles, dependency, and alienation are paired with evocative songs such as Dean Martin’s “Memories Are Made of This.” It is appropriate that images of her subjects’ fantasies and sorrows should be realized as short-lived projections. The slide projector was adopted as an artistic vehicle in the 1960s and 1970s for public performance-based work, and The Ballad codifies more performative presentations by the artist in the clubs and cinemas of 1980s New York’s artistic demimonde.Goldin’s pictures, like images of family vacations or holidays, embrace photography’s potential for immediacy, emotion, and anecdote. Unlike such snapshots, however, they capture Goldin, her friends, and her family in moments of intimacy—lovemaking, violence, addiction, hospitalization—and depict the rollercoaster of human emotions that accompanies these moments. In this way, The Ballad offers a more exposed, and potentially more honest, version of the traditional domestic slideshow.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/187155/the-ballad-of-sexual-dependency
usa_66,Robert Smithson,Sixteen mirrors and chalk,Chalk-Mirror Displacement,"The painter, sculptor, theorist, filmmaker, and photographer Robert Smithson helped pioneer the Earthwork Movement of the late 1960s and 1970s, which took as its subject the artistic reordering of the American landscape in its many varied forms. Chalk-Mirror Displacement belongs to a series of works, executed in 1968 and 1969, that combine mirrors and organic materials. Eight double-sided mirrors radiate like spokes from the center of a chalk pile located on the gallery floor. As they slice through the pile, the mirrors separate the chalk into almost identical wedge-shaped compartments. The double reflection in each compartment preserves the illusion of the whole pile, making the mirror dividers appear nearly invisible. This work is also one of Smithson’s Site/Nonsite pieces. The artist referred to the first stage of the work as a “Site Incarnation,” which he created for a particular outdoor location: in this case, a chalk quarry in Oxted, York, England. After setting up and photographing the Site piece, the artist then dismantled it. The materials were subsequently reinstalled in the Nonsite location, the seminal 1969 exhibition When Attitude Becomes Form at the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London. This process purposefully blurred the boundaries between art and its environment, within and without gallery walls.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/93345/chalk-mirror-displacement
usa_67,David Smith,Steel,Tanktotem I,"For David Smith, steel was the quintessential modern material of the 1950s—a symbol of progress, movement, power, destruction, and brutality. Following the Cubist model, Smith combined various industrial pieces, often discarded scraps, into an open network of abstract forms. In the early 1950s, he began conceiving his sculptures as parts of titled groups, which allowed him to explore multiple permutations of a single theme. Tanktotem is a series in which Smith incorporated boiler parts and cylindrical steel tank parts that he purchased from a catalog. With their characteristic upright forms, these works straddle the boundary between the human figure and abstract sign.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/79379/tanktotem-i
usa_68,Clyfford Still,Oil on canvas,Untitled,"In the late 1940s Clyfford Still, along with Barnett Newman and Mark Rothko, originated the type of Abstract Expressionism known as color-field painting, a term used to describe very large canvases dominated by monumental expanses of intense, homogeneous color. Like most of Still’s mature work, Untitled is a sheer wall of paint, imposing and self-sustaining, that makes no concessions to conventional notions of beauty or pictorial illusionism. This painting’s textural effects give it an insistent, complex materiality. Dominated by blacks applied with both a trowel and brushes, the surface is by turns reflective and chalky, granular and smooth, feathery and leaden. These variegated black surfaces are even more emphatic because their continuity is broken by areas of blank canvas and white paint. Like veins in igneous rock, streaks of orange, yellow, and green paint are embedded in the black voids. Mediating between the light and dark masses are areas of crimson, heightened at the edges, as if inflamed, by bright orange.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/146991/untitled
usa_69,Arshile Gorky,Oil on canvas,The Plough and the Song,"Born in Turkish Armenia, Arshile Gorky immigrated to the United States in the 1920s and became an influential member of the New York art scene. Profoundly interested in avant-garde European art, he experimented with a variety of styles. Young artists working in New York were particularly stimulated by the European Surrealists, many of whom moved to the city before and during World War II and whose circle Gorky joined. The 1940s, especially the years 1944–47, marked the creation of his most important work, produced in a kind of stream of consciousness or “automatic” manner of painting. The Plough and the Song reflects the artist’s indebtedness to the lyrical Surrealism of Joan Miró, but the sketchy handling of paint, translucent color, and tumbling pile of shapes are hallmarks of Gorky’s mature work. A delicate contour line delineates the biomorphic forms in the center of the composition, in marked contrast to the loose brushwork that defines the background. The title signals Gorky’s nostalgia for his heritage, as the artist wrote in 1944: “You cannot imagine the fertility of forms that leap from our Armenian plows… . And the songs, our ancient songs of the Armenian people, our suffering people… . So many shapes, so many shapes and ideas, happily a secret treasure to which I have been entrusted the key.” Deeply earthbound and poetic, The Plough and the Song is at once a still life, a landscape, and a fantasy.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16964/the-plough-and-the-song
usa_70,Frank Lloyd Wright,Poplar and leather,Spindle Cube Chair,"This elegant spindle cube chair is an early example from Frank Lloyd Wright’s home and studio. In 1889 Wright built a house for his young family on Forest Avenue in Oak Park, a new suburb just west of Chicago; ten years later, he opened an attached studio and designed it and the home’s interior in accordance with his philosophy of simplicity and integrity of materials. Among his furniture experiments were heavy, solid cube chairs. By the first decade of the twentieth century, Wright had refined his early design into that of this chair, adding spindles, a subtly tapering crest rail, and gently curving leg ends to produce an effect that is equal parts sophistication and simplicity. The spindles themselves were a legacy of William Morris–inspired ladder-back dining chairs, as well as the Arts and Crafts approach of contrasting positive and negative space. This chair was also influenced by the reticulated ceilings and walls of Japanese homes.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/190558/spindle-cube-chair
usa_71,Brice Marden,Oil and wax on two joined canvases,Rodeo,"During the past four decades, Brice Marden has played a key role in maintaining the vitality of abstract painting. Rodeo, a work of imposing scale and stark presence, represents a high point of his early career. Two rectangular canvas panels—one yellow, the other gray—are joined to form an eight-foot square. Each canvas is pulled across a deep (two and one-eighth-inch) stretcher and painted with a combination of oil and beeswax. The stretchers and thick, opaque pigment give Rodeo a sense of weight and a sculptural presence. Like all of Marden’s paintings, Rodeo is insistently handmade. The artist laid multiple layers of the medium over his canvas panels, adding an extraordinary sense of tactility to this relatively simple composition. The line joining the two panels may suggest a horizon line, and thus a landscape. The juxtaposition of two rectangular fields also recalls the work of Mark Rothko. In contrast to Rothko’s luminous, floating fields of color, Marden’s twin panels seem determinedly earthbound, presented as physical facts rather than as expressions of spiritual aspiration.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/146988/rodeo
usa_72,Dawoud Bey,Internal dye diffusion transfer prints (6),"Candida and Her Mother, Celia, II","In the dispiriting years just after World War I, the Irish poet William Butler Yeats wrote the famous line: “Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold.” We have since gotten used to living with pieces—pieces of time, heritage, even morality. Although Dawoud Bey sometimes seeks a solitary moment or a single point of view in his photographs, he knows that the essence of what lives before the camera often eludes such an approach. Thus, in Candida and Her Mother, Celia, II, he emphasized the complexities of mother-daughter relationships. The grid format of his composition includes frames in which the mother’s and daughter’s faces and hands are captured together, as well as separate frames in which they gaze back at the artist. In the wholesome beauty of this loving family bond, Bey constructed a cohesive sanctuary apart from the horrors and ambiguities of our time.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/160201/candida-and-her-mother-celia-ii
usa_73,Campana Brothers (Designer),Bent steel wire and epoxy paint,Corallo Chair,"Fernando and Humberto Campana, designers based in São Paulo, Brazil, are recognized for work that draws inspiration from the culture of their city and the rich tradition of handicrafts made there. Known for transforming freely available waste materials such as bubble wrap, off-cuts of wood, plastic piping, and rope into furniture and other products, the brothers are keen to situate the craftsman’s skills at the center of their projects. In some of their designs, the Campanas use cast-off materials in a way that invites social commentary; in others, they combine rigid steel and informally layered everyday elements, suggesting the confluence of Modernist aesthetics and popular culture that is constantly at play in their work. Corallo Chair, their most ambitious piece to date, illustrates their interest in operating at the frontier of art and design. Made of bent steel wire and painted bright coral, each chair is handcrafted, ensuring that no two are the same. The branchlike form, taken from shapes found in nature, is a response to the chair’s function as an outdoor seating element. Ultimately, however, what anchors the Campanas’ efforts is a divine optimism that something beautiful can result from limited means.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/188845/corallo-chair
usa_74,Barnett Newman,Oil on canvas,The Beginning,"A key figure in the Abstract Expressionist movement, Barnett Newman is widely considered one of the most innovative and influential painters of the twentieth century. A brilliant colorist and a master of expansive spatial effects, he pioneered a new pictorial language that was at once emphatically abstract and powerfully emotive. For Newman, the spiritual content of abstract art was of paramount importance. Although his works seem largely focused on the formal qualities of painting, he insisted that they possessed symbolic meaning. This meaning was never explicit, but he often alluded to it in the titles of his works, as with The Beginning. In the mid-1940s Newman became preoccupied with the Old Testament story of Creation and began selecting titles in reference to the book of Genesis. In this painting, the bands of paint that emerge from the base of the canvas interrupt a richly variegated field of color, a sort of primordial fog. The artist created these three stripes with the aid of masking tape, which he applied to the canvas as a guideline before adding the surrounding color. This work is an important precursor to Newman’s mature paintings, which are characterized by a single vertical band, or “zip,” that divides the composition.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/73417/the-beginning
usa_75,Lee Krasner,"Oil paint, gouache, and cut and torn painted paper, with adhesive residue on cream laid paper",Black and White,"Lee Krasner’s pictures from the 1940s on were informed by her understanding of the Abstract Expressionist ideal: to infuse abstract, painterly forms with mysterious and significant content. The substantial body of work she created shows her sustained development toward a refined expression of this concept. Black and White is one of Krasner’s first and most important works in a group of early paper collages. The drawings that she disassembled to create these collages echo the work of her husband, Jackson Pollock, from the same period. According to the art historian Ellen Landau, however, it is difficult to determine who originated the strategy of cannibalizing previous works to create new ones. Throughout her career, Krasner employed the technique more consistently than Pollock.In Black and White, Krasner not only appropriated her own discarded markings but also referred to Pollock’s early-1940s tactic of quoting Pablo Picasso’s studio subjects. She reversed the gender implications of Picasso’s prototypes by showing, at right, a female figure who may be a painter contemplating her works of art, or perhaps a woman looking in a mirror. The artist’s redeployment of studio scraps in a new context helped her, paradoxically, to mark out new aesthetic territory.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/131385/black-and-white
usa_76,Agnes Martin,"India ink, graphite, and gesso on canvas",Untitled #12,"Agnes Martin mastered a rigorously pared-down idiom that combined painting and drawing. The artist aligned herself with Abstract Expressionists such as Mark Rothko, admiring their investigations of chromatic color schemes, allover compositions, and emotional content. In the 1960s, she developed a vocabulary of grids and graphs that prompted critics to compare her work to the radical simplicity and intellectualism of Minimal and Conceptual artists. Indeed, Untitled #12—a crisply stated graphite grid on a light-gray ground—seems at first to be an exemplar of Minimalism. But close observation reveals a flickering light and extremely refined touch that suggest a spiritual, rather than purely aesthetic, stance. Martin’s deeply solitary nature led her to achieve a quiet, tenuous balance between the material and the immaterial, the sensual and the austere.The artist stopped painting in 1969; she moved from New York City to a remote, rural area of New Mexico. In 1975, she began to paint again. Although Martin maintained that her art was not abstracted from nature —“Work like mine,” she remarked, “describes the subtle emotions that are beyond words, like music”—the paintings she produced in the Southwest embody the quiet landscapes, even light, and desert tonalities of her surroundings.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/89403/untitled-12
usa_77,Florine Stettheimer,"Oil, and possibly ink, on canvas",Portrait of Virgil Thomson,"In the 1920s and 1930s, Florine Stettheimer painted imaginative portraits and representations of the life and world of celebrated members of the American avant-garde, including artists Marcel Duchamp and Elie Nadelman; novelist Carl van Vechten; and here the composer Virgil Thomson, who is perhaps best known for his opera Four Saints in Three Acts. First staged in 1934 with an all-black cast, the work featured a libretto by Gertrude Stein and striking cellophane sets and costumes by Stettheimer, which achieved instant notoriety.Stettheimer developed her unique blend of faux-naive art and avant-garde innovations during the 1910s. With little concern for proportion or perspective, the artist depicted fantastic scenes, combining past and present, real and imagined, near and far, which she populated with slim, stylized figures who seem to float or dance through space. In this painting, an ecstatic-looking Thomson, awash in a flood of supernatural light, gazes at a mask bearing Stein’s features, which seems to represent a source of inspiration. Alluding to music’s heavenly quality, this encounter between creative forces takes place on a bank of clouds, complete with a tiny stage and actors, lettered banners, and fluttering doves.The chained lion to the right of Thomson might refer to the power of music to soothe even savage beasts or to Saint Jerome and the Evangelist Mark, who are frequently depicted in the company of lions. Reinforcing the link between creativity and spirituality are banners that combine the names of two saints from the opera, Ignatius of Loyola and Teresa of Ávila, with those of Thomson and Stein. However, the artist’s own name—Florine St.—appears in reverse order to the others, perhaps a witty abbreviation of her signature. Stettheimer designed the scalloped frame, which appropriately sets off her fanciful vision.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/49686/portrait-of-virgil-thomson
usa_78,Yves Tanguy,Oil on wood,Untitled,"The largely self-taught Yves Tanguy decided to become an artist around 1923, when he was inspired by a painting by Giorgio de Chirico that he saw in a shop window. Tanguy became interested in Surrealism a year later, after reading the periodical La révolution surréaliste. André Breton welcomed him into the Surrealist group in 1925. Inspired by the metaphysical qualities of de Chirico’s work, as well as the biomorphic forms of Jean Arp, Max Ernst, and Joan Miró, Tanguy quickly developed his own fantastic vocabulary of organic, amoeba-like shapes that populate mysterious, dreamlike settings.Tanguy painted this primordial landscape on a hinged wooden screen. Little information exists about the circumstances of the work’s making, but the artist probably intended it for a patron’s home, since many Surrealists were interested in the decorative arts and produced folding screens, furniture, and other domestic objects. In this unusual example, although the screen retains the potential to close off the private sphere, it simultaneously opens up more intimate dreams and fantasies to the outside world.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/72728/untitled
usa_79,Jasper Johns,Higgins ink on frosted mylar,Perilous Night,"Jasper Johns began his career in the mid-1950s by re-creating, with great precision, such familiar images as targets, letters, numbers, and flags. Although his subject matter has become less commonplace, he continues to “borrow” from the public domain. Perilous Night, for instance, owes its title to a pivotal and expressive piece of music written by the American composer John Cage (1912–1992) in 1945. Both score and cover sheet are rendered on the right-hand side of the drawing with Johns’s characteristically fluid handling of ink. On the sheet’s left side is a freehand rendition—abstracted, reversed, and turned ninety degrees—of a single, terror-stricken soldier from the Resurrection panel of Matthias Grünewald’s sixteenth-century masterwork the Isenheim Altarpiece (Unterlinden Museum, Colmar). Between the soldier and the musical score is a black imprint of Johns’s right arm, evidence perhaps of the creative power that can merge two disparate images into a cogent statement. The overcome soldier witnessing the Resurrection of Christ and a piece of music marking a key transition in a composer’s career both point to “perilous nights” that can change the course of a human life. Characteristically, Johns also explored the same subject in different media. This somberly colored drawing derives from a painting of the same name (1982; National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC).",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/90300/perilous-night
usa_80,Vija Celmins,Oil on canvas,Explosion at Sea,"Explosion at Sea belongs to a group of paintings by Vija Celmins on the themes of war, technology, and devastation. In the mid-1960s, the artist began to use photographs from books, magazines, and newspapers found at secondhand stores and yard sales as the point of departure for her work. After locating a wealth of material on World War II—a conflict that was the backdrop of her childhood in Latvia—Celmins employed subtle layers of precise brushstrokes to construct a detailed image of an attack on an aircraft carrier. The resulting painting, like most of her works of this moment, creates a disturbing contrast between the intimacy of the format and brushwork and the haunting seriousness of the theme.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/146905/explosion-at-sea
usa_81,Ed Paschke,Oil on linen,Minnie,"Ed Paschke is celebrated as one of the leading figures of the Chicago Imagist Movement, a group of late-1960s artists whose expressive style of figurative painting was rooted in outsider art, popular culture, and Surrealism. Drawing inspiration from New York–based Pop Art, Paschke often culled his subjects from newspapers, tabloid magazines, and television, producing work that taps into the movement’s kitsch aesthetic. Although his paintings depict representational imagery, they play heavily upon expressionist distortion, particularly in his use of psychedelic, inharmonious colors. Paschke’s love of urban subcultures and his interest in the underbelly of American society translated into a penchant for sensational subject matter. In his early works, Paschke painted circus freaks and other marginal figures, in marked contrast to, for example, Andy Warhol’s overriding concern with mainstream celebrity. Minnie, which depicts a now-anonymous individual silhouetted against a background of emanating light, is typical of his artistic production from this period. With her theatrical costume, elaborate hairdo, and bizarre makeup, this larger-than-life figure becomes a grotesque. By painting a flamboyant, overtly sexualized underworld character in a peculiar mixture of electric hues, Paschke added heat to Pop Art’s cool aesthetic.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/97402/minnie
usa_82,Louis H. Sullivan (Architect),Graphite on Strathmore paper,"System of Architectural Ornament, Plate 16, Impromptu!","In 1922 the Art Institute’s recently opened Burnham Library of Architecture com-missioned Louis Sullivan to make drawings illustrating his renowned theories of architectural ornament. These masterpieces were published together as A System of Architectural Ornament, According with a Philosophy of Man’s Powers by the American Institute of Architects in 1924; this was Sullivan’s final statement about the geometry underlying both natural and man-made forms. In his search for an original American architecture, Sullivan drew his inspiration from nature, not unlike the nineteenth-century American poets and writers whom he emulated. Like them, he intended ornament to function evocatively as well as to represent organic growth, evolving from closed geometric units to open, efflorescent forms. In Impromptu!, the sixteenth of the twenty delicate drawings in his treatise, Sullivan produced one of his most open, vibrant, and fluent compositions. Giving free rein to expansive whiplash appendages and spiral stalks, the architect combined nature’s infinite creative variation and incessant change with an intense emotional expressionism. To convey these poetic nuances, Sullivan’s correlating notation describes the design as entering “the domain of Virtuosity, Romance and Symbolism.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/131541/system-of-architectural-ornament-plate-16-impromptu
usa_83,Alfred Stieglitz,Palladium print,Georgia O’Keeffe—Hands and Thimble,"Alfred Stieglitz campaigned throughout the first half of the twentieth century to legitimize photography and modern art. He founded an exhibiting organization, the Photo-Secession, then the periodical Camera Work, and finally a series of galleries. The most influential of these, the gallery known simply as 291, operating from 1908 until 1917, introduced the work of such leaders of the European avant-garde as Paul Cézanne, Henri Matisse, and Pablo Picasso. Georgia O’Keeffe, who became Stieglitz’s wife in 1924, was among the progressive American artists whose work he also exhibited at 291. In a search for objective truth and pure form, the innovative photographer took some five hundred photographs of O’Keeffe between 1917 and 1937. The essence of O’Keeffe, he felt, was not confined to her head and face alone; equally expressive were her torso, feet, and especially her hands, as seen here. What resulted is a “composite portrait” of the painter, in which each photograph, revealing her intrinsic nature at a particular moment, can stand alone as an independently expressive form. When these serial images are viewed as a whole, they portray the essence of O’Keeffe’s many different “selves.”For more on the Alfred Stieglitz collection at the Art Institute, along with in-depth object information, please visit the website: The Alfred Stieglitz Collection.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/66434/georgia-o-keeffe-hands-and-thimble

Although both received traditional artistic training at the city’s academies, they were particularly drawn to the modernist techniques of James McNeill Whistler. Murphy employed a thin, almost transparent application of paint and a muted palette of gray and green.

usa_85,Walker Evans,Gelatin silver print,Alabama Cotton Tenant Farmer’s Wife,"“Unrelieved, bare-faced, revelatory fact,” read the monograph that accompanied Walker Evans’s photographs when many of them were displayed at New York’s Museum of Modern Art in 1938. Taken during the preceding two years, while he traveled throughout the South for the Farm Security Administration (FSA) under the direction of Roy Stryker, these images document the plight of the rural poor during the Depression. With clinical precision and a fastidious reserve, Evans photographed main streets, storefronts, hand-painted signs, gas stations, abandoned buildings, and automobiles. He took pictures of tenant farmers’ homes—their kitchens, beds, bureau drawers, and fireplaces—with and without their occupants. Taken for Fortune magazine while Evans, on leave from the FSA, was traveling with the writer James Agee, this famous photograph shows a tenant farmer’s wife standing outside her house. With patient dignity, she looks straight at the viewer, a shy half-smile on her lips. This work is part of a remarkable collaboration with Agee published in the book Let Us Now Praise Famous Men (1941). As one of the nation’s finest documentary photographers, Evans continued this exacting and lucid description of American culture throughout his career.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/13720/alabama-cotton-tenant-farmer-s-wife
usa_86,Gertrude Abercrombie,Oil on canvas,Self-Portrait of My Sister,"At first glance, Self-Portrait of My Sister appears to be a relatively straightforward representation of a young woman. It was painted by the Chicago Surrealist Gertrude Abercrombie but seems to lack the mysterious imagery of her landscapes and interior scenes. Further examination, however, reveals subtle touches of her dark aesthetic, beginning with the title itself. Self-Portrait of My Sister is an enigmatic reference to a sister who did not exist, for the artist was in fact an only child. However, Abercrombie initially referred to this painting as “Portrait of Artist as Ideal,” a phrase that reveals her underlying meaning. Abercrombie’s work was invariably self-referential; as she put it, “It’s always myself that I paint, but not actually, because I don’t look that good or cute.” Her reference to a fictitious, prettier sister hints at her desire to be a different person, a longing she satisfied through self-portraiture.Here, the artist exaggerated and idealized her appearance, depicting herself with an extraordinarily long, slender neck; vivid blue eyes; and sharpened features. She portrayed herself wearing black gloves and a flat-brimmed hat trimmed with a bunch of grapes, all motifs that recurred with some frequency in her paintings and acted as symbols of her presence. Such inclusions helped shape her individual variant of Surrealism, which she felt was based in realism. “Surrealism is meant for me,” she remarked, “because I am a pretty realistic person but don’t like all I see. So I dream that it is changed. Then I change it to the way I want it. It is almost always pretty real. Only mystery and fantasy have been added. All foolishness has been taken out. It becomes my own dream.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/198809/self-portrait-of-my-sister
usa_87,Carleton Watkins,Albumen print,"Big River, from the Rancherie, Mendocino, California","Like the vast and untapped landscape of the American West, Carleton Watkins’s photographic images are grand in spirit and in size. Using a giant wet-plate camera whose thick glass negatives—coated with a sensitized emulsion called collodion and exposed while still wet—were often as large as the average easel painting of the time, Watkins here fused a sense of the picturesque with a Romantic expression of nature’s timelessness, immensity, and silence. The trees are sharply defined, still, and majestic. Depicted with equal clarity is the river, which winds into the receding hills. This technical and aesthetic perfection was all the more remarkable considering the difficulty of the wet-plate process for a frontier photographer. In the field, Watkins had to transport (with the aid of several pack mules) mammoth cameras, dark tents, chemicals, and as many as four hundred glass plates. He also had to contend with constant packing and unpacking, the lack of pure water, and the tendency of dust to adhere to the sticky collodion. Photographs such as Big River and Watkins’s famous views of Yosemite (which helped persuade the US Congress to pass legislation protecting the valley’s wilderness) provided the world with some of the first glimpses of the American West.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/63554/big-river-from-the-rancherie-mendocino-california
usa_88,James McNeill Whistler,Watercolor and opaque watercolor over traces of black chalk on brown wove paper laid down on card,Green and Blue: The Dancer,"Inspired by Greek sculpture and Japanese prints, James McNeill Whistler became entranced with portraying the female form clad in diaphanous drapery in the 1890s. He developed this theme in all the media in which he worked, including transfer lithography, oil, pastel, and watercolor. The artist usually provided garments for his models to wear, often classical gossamer gowns with high waists and crossed bodices paired with brightly colored kerchiefs. His models needed a certain degree of strength and agility, as he sometimes asked them to dance about his studio until he found a suitable pose. In Green and Blue: The Dancer, Whistler employed thin watercolor washes to distill the graceful movements of his lissome young model. The brown paper on which he painted lends opacity to the washes, thereby adding subtle weight to the thin veils of fabric draping the figure.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/111164/green-and-blue-the-dancer
usa_89,Li Huayi,"Unmounted, ink and color on paper",Landscape,"Impressive in scale and refinement, this depiction of a dramatic ravine evokes the monumental landscapes attributed to China’s foremost painters of the tenth and eleventh centuries. Like those early masters, Li Huayi captured the continuous momentum and flux of nature. Steeply curving banks edged by windswept trees tower precariously over the water, whose receding flow is echoed by the cloud-like mist hovering above. This dynamic image is rendered by the artist’s distinctively expressive method of painting. After defining the composition with large areas of ink spilled onto the paper or worked with a broad brush, Li gradually rendered mass and solidity with denser layers and then allowed the paper to dry before adding details with a small, finely tapered brush. By the artist’s own account, such powerfully fresh landscapes exist only in his mind and do not reflect direct observation of nature.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/183277/landscape
usa_90,Martin Puryear,"Red cedar, cypress, poplar, and ash",Lever #1,"Martin Puryear has produced an expertly handcrafted body of sculpture characterized by extreme elegance of form and organic simplicity. Influenced by his travels through Africa, Asia, Europe, and the United States, Puryear fuses modern traditions—his work pays homage to Constantin Brâncusi, Jean Arp, and Scandinavian furniture designers—with non-Western architecture, sculpture, and craft. Consisting of a tall, narrow, wood vessel and a dramatically arched top flap that seems poised to slam down upon it, Lever #1 exemplifies the artist’s ongoing exploration of the relationship between interior space, form, and volume. The sculpture suggests an array of possible associations, including a deep-hulled boat, a coffin, or sexual themes. It also reflects some of the most celebrated methods of avant-garde art, notably Constructivism and assemblage. While the sculpture alludes to recognizable forms and subjects, Puryear intended for it to remain independent of specific interpretations. The surface is alive with the remnants of glue, staples, and other marks of construction; these residual effects serve as a reminder that, above all else, the work is about the process of making sculpture.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/90443/lever-1
usa_91,André Kertész,Gelatin silver print,Mondrian’s Glasses and Pipe,"Hungarian-born André Kertész had been living in Paris for less than a year when he visited the studio of the Dutch painter Piet Mondrian. Mondrian’s Eyeglasses and Pipe is one of a group of beautiful still lifes that the photographer took that day. Within the austere clarity of these simple geometric forms—common manufactured items that Mondrian used daily—Kertész captured the essence of this master of abstraction, both his aspirations to order and his slight and human divergences from it. The insistent angularity of the stark white table is offset by the sculptural curves of the glasses, bowl, and pipe, curves that were rigorously excluded from Mondrian’s art. Throughout Kertész’s long career, he sought the revelation of the found still life, of an abstract or resonating image discovered in an elliptical view. His signature practice of snaring and fixing these lyrical perceptions was facilitated by his later use of light, portable handheld cameras that enabled him to remain mobile and agile even when making still lifes. Kertész’s work significantly influenced that of his contemporaries Brassaï and Henri Cartier-Bresson.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/50157/mondrian-s-glasses-and-pipe

With an eye attuned to color and a belief in the power of aesthetics to effect change, he has made lush, beautiful photographs of often terrible subjects. He is perhaps best known for his Desert Cantos, an extensive and ongoing series exploring the splendors and horrors of the American desert—man-made floods and fires, military-scarred terrain, pits of dead animals, and sublime night skies. Like an epic poem, the series is divided into cantos, now numbering twenty-eight. Canto III, “The Flood,” focuses on the Salton Sea, a lake that was created by an engineering mistake at the beginning of the twentieth century. The lake was stocked with fish in the 1950s to promote tourism but became permanently flooded a few decades later, leaving odd and often ironic reminders of human folly poking out of the water; the fish (seen at the bottom right of the picture) experience summer die-off due to the warming of the salty water and choking algae blooms. With biblical overtones of the apocalypse, Misrach here expanded the landscape tradition from a depiction of the picturesque to an expression of political engagement.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/191454/dead-fish-salton-sea-from-the-series-desert-cantos-iii-the-flood
usa_94,Jack Whitten,Acrylic on canvas,Khee II,"In the early 1960s, as a young student in New York, Jack Whitten established ties with an older generation of black artists that included Romare Bearden and Jacob Lawrence, as well as with leading Abstract Expressionists such as Willem de Kooning, Ad Reinhardt, and Franz Kline. During the second half of the decade, Whitten began working toward an entirely unique relationship to painting that he described in this way: “About 1965 I wrote on my studio wall one day, the image is photographic; I must photograph my thoughts.” By 1970 the artist had eliminated both expressive color and figuration from his work, launching a ten-year series of paintings that capture, like a camera, the often chance-based immediacies of his dynamic studio process.Khee II exhibits all the hallmarks of Whitten’s mature process-derived paintings. As with other works from this period, the artist placed a variety of flat, shaped objects beneath the canvas. After preparing the surface with gesso, he layered it with thin sheets of colored Japanese rice paper. The rice paper dissolved, leaving behind pure pigment. Whitten then pulled a rake or other notched tool—which he calls a “developer,” in obvious reference to a photographer’s chemicals—across the work’s surface. This served both to impress the shapes from below, effectively embossing the canvas, and to disperse color on top of it. The result is a series of ghostlike images and alternating rows of color that vibrate with subtle luminosity. This is a glowing evocative abstract painting that is also a layer-by-layer document of its own making.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/218612/khee-ii
usa_95,Robert Frank,"Gelatin silver print, from ""The Americans"" (1955/56)","Fourth of July, Jay, New York","In 1955 the Swiss-born photographer Robert Frank rented a secondhand car and, for the next two years, traveled with his 35mm Leica camera throughout the United States, capturing his impressions with the ironic distance of an outsider. Made possible by a Guggenheim Foundation grant (the first awarded to a foreigner), this photographic odyssey resulted in a landmark book, Les Américains, published in France in 1958. The brilliant technical “wrongness” of Frank’s gritty, rough, and graceless images represented a new and highly influential expressionistic approach to photographic observation. Meant to be viewed as a series, Frank’s photographs are filled with such Americana as luncheonettes and jukeboxes, tailfins and motels, and the American flag. Dominating this depiction of the nation’s annual birthday party, which Frank made before embarking on his trip around the United States, the star-spangled banner hardly waves bravely or freely. Instead it hangs down over a Fourth of July picnic, sheer and patched, like the bars of a prison. As the Beat writer Jack Kerouac noted in his introduction to the controversial 1959 American edition of Frank’s book: “With that little camera that he raises and snaps with one hand he sucked a sad poem right out of America onto film.” Frank subsequently turned to filmmaking and returned to still photography upon his move to Nova Scotia in 1969.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/87163/fourth-of-july-jay-new-york
usa_96,Jim Nutt,Acrylic on Plexiglas with aluminum and rubber; in artist's painted frame,Miss E. Knows,"Jim Nutt is a principal member of the Hairy Who, an irreverent group of artists that emerged in Chicago during the late 1960s. Exhibiting Surrealist-inspired work aimed at subverting artistic conventions and standards of taste, these artists became part of the Chicago Imagist movement. Although each member developed a distinct style, collectively they shared an emphasis on intuition and spontaneity and an affection for wordplay and humor. In his earliest paintings, Nutt referenced popular culture, particularly painted store windows and pinball machines, through his choice of medium and support—acrylic paint on Plexiglas. In addition, many elements of his early style relate to the comic strip: hard, crisp forms stand out boldly against simple backgrounds. In Miss E. Knows he also appropriated a sequential format, incorporating small, framed images in the upper-left corner of the painting. The work depicts a grotesquely imagined, highly sexualized female figure—Nutt’s satire of ideal beauty. The artist included the cartoonish light beam across her eyes as a reference to the cinema. By attaching objects such as rubber tubing and a coat hook to its surface, Nutt heightened the Surrealist effect of this image.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/35198/miss-e-knows
usa_97,Edward Steichen,Gum bichromate print,"Rodin, Le Penseur","“What is true of the oil or watercolor is equally true of the photograph,” Edward Steichen once said, aptly expressing the overt pictorial intent of Rodin, Le Penseur. This romantic silhouette portrait depicts Auguste Rodin seated in his studio opposite his famous work Le Penseur, with his sculpture of Victor Hugo in the background. In 1902, the year he made this photograph, Steichen believed he would become a painter, and he visited Rodin and his circle of artists and admirers often. But as a founding member of Alfred Stieglitz’s Photo-Secession group, Steichen increasingly created photographs that were the artistic equivalents of his paintings, in the hope of winning artistic credibility for the newer art form. Here the artist expertly manipulated the elastic and expressive gum-bichromate method, in which the application of water and brushwork in the printing process can soften or omit details, reduce dark spaces, and even change light into dark (and vice versa). The result is a combination of two separate images, both dramatically posed and lit, into a striking, painterly photograph.For more on Edward Steichen’s work in the Art Institute’s collection visit the website: Edward Steichen’s World War I Years.For more on the Alfred Stieglitz collection at the Art Institute, along with in-depth object information, please visit the website: The Alfred Stieglitz Collection.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/66683/rodin-le-penseur
usa_98,Edward Weston,Platinum print,Washbowl,"In 1923 Edward Weston embarked on a new life in Mexico, leaving California behind him. He set up a portrait studio with his muse and apprentice, Tina Modotti, who introduced him to such artists as Diego Rivera and José Clemente Orozco. Stimulated by the vital Mexican culture—as well as by his previous contacts with the great photographers Charles Sheeler, Alfred Stieglitz, and Paul Strand—Weston’s soft-focus, painterly style underwent a radical change. “The camera must be used for a recording of life,” he wrote during this period, “for rendering the very substance and quintessence of the thing itself.” This simple metal washbowl, which he stored under his sink, is an example of the new and unconventional subjects Weston began to photograph during his Mexican sojourn. In his obsession with clarity of form and precision of image, he pioneered a technique that he called “previsualizing”—looking at a scene through the camera and determining how that would translate to a print; any cropping, trimming, or enlarging of the print was rejected as a betrayal of vision. Here he captured the worn metal and porcelain surfaces of the washbowl and sink with sensuous, almost preternatural clarity. An important transitional piece, this work prefigures Weston’s exquisite and erotic studies of nudes, shells, and plant forms.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/70739/%E5%9D%A1%E7%8D%A8%E6%89%AF%E7%9D%AC

Along with fellow artist Jasper Johns, Rauschenberg charted a viable path out of Abstract Expressionism, the predominant artistic practice when he emerged during the 1950s.Rauschenberg is best known for the Combine, a painting-sculpture hybrid that integrated humble objects, ephemeral materials, and found images into works that bridge what he called “the gap between art and life.” Untitled is an early work from this seminal series. A sock, a postcard, and an army-flare parachute are among the used and discarded remnants of everyday life held in balance by the expressive brush-strokes and spatters of paint. Echoing this application, the strings of the parachute drip like paint from the canvas, forming a catenary, the curve imposed by the force of gravity on a string suspended freely from two points. With this rupture of the picture plane, the fictive space of the artwork’s surface engages the actual space occupied by the viewer.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/229354/untitled
usa_101,Cindy Sherman,Chromogenic print; artist's proof number one of one,Untitled #88,"Cindy Sherman’s staged photographs explore the pervasive effects of mass-media images on individual identities. Since the late 1970s, the artist has served as both photographer and model for a large cast of fictional personalities created primarily through costume, hair, makeup, and lighting. In 1981 she began a series of large color photographs that mimic the horizontal format of a magazine centerfold. Critiques of these glossy spreads, Sherman’s representations are fraught with anxiety, vulnerability, and longing. In Untitled #88, she depicted herself as a young, disheveled blonde girl; her fragility and isolation are underscored by her huddled body language and pensive stare. An imposing darkness surrounds her, except for the warm glow from what is most likely a fire, the only source of light in the picture. While the girl’s specific situation remains ambiguous, the photograph illustrates that, for Sherman, gender roles are performative.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/110634/untitled-88
usa_102,Louise Lawler,Silver dye-bleach print,Monogram,"Since the early 1980s, Louise Lawler has photographed works of art installed in auction houses, corporate headquarters, galleries, museums, and private homes in order to demonstrate how an object’s display and contextualization can shape its meaning. The resulting images transcend pure documentation. Her appropriation of works in situ addresses the broader social and economic issues that structure modes of presentation. These early photographs, often displayed as a triptych, deal with the theme of monogramming and, by extension, personal vanity. Depicting a couch with a Lacoste emblem, Alligator draws our attention to the Donald Judd sculpture above it and the reflection of the artist in its surface. Untitled shows a Jasper Johns painting, visible through the clear glass of a vitrine that exhibits Robert Rauschenberg’s oddly titled Monogram (1955–59; Moderna Museet, Stockholm). Lastly, Monogram depicts Johns’s White Flag (1955; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) hanging over a bed with a duvet lavishly embroidered with the owner’s initials. This sequence shows that Lawler is constantly making connections between various categories of signs, curatorial concerns of private collectors and museums, and the questions raised by redisplaying these pieces as the subject matter of “original” works of art.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/187165/monogram
usa_103,Diana Thater,"Five-channel digital color video with sound (projection), nine-monitor cube, light filters, and existing architecture; artist's proof from an edition of three",Delphine,"Widely recognized as a pioneer of video art as installation, California-based artist Diana Thater is best known for work featuring images of animals such as bees, horses, and wolves. In Delphine, which takes as its primary subject wild dolphins interacting with humans, the artist worked for the very first time with untrained animals in their natural habitat. Complex spatial thinking is key to Thater’s projects; she understands installation art as a dialogue between sculpture and architecture. Projected on a large scale—onto entire ceilings, walls, and floors—her work thoroughly transforms the physical realities of the spaces it inhabits. This generic and spatial fluidity blurs conventional boundaries between the work and the viewer. The artist also insists on revealing how her images are made. Shot in both digital video and film, Delphine was edited without regard for separating the different media. Clarity and grain flow together as the immediacy and flatness of video gives way to the depth of film. These self-conscious production methods are mirrored by Thater’s particular aesthetic of presentation: she always leaves her equipment in full view inside the installation. This transparent approach, the artist insisted, “does not, as some people might have us believe, preclude transcendence. This is ultimately my point—that neither magic nor superficial beauty is required to approach the sublime.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/184193/delphine
usa_104,Pope.L,"Oil, acrylic, flash paint, marker, pen, collage, thumbtacks and tape on torn paper",Finnish Painting,"Pope.L is known for provocative, physically taxing performances as well as for text-based drawings and paintings. Many of the former have transpired unceremoniously in incidental public spaces such as parks, sidewalks, and gutters, with the artist donning variously symbolic attire — a skirt made of dollar bills and a sausage-link chain for ATM Piece (1997) and a capeless Superman costume for the ongoing Great White Way. Readily identifiable themes in Pope.L’s art include the disruption of conventions of cultural identity, the paradoxical idea of lack as a source of value, and the explosion of traditional artistic categories. He applies the term drawing liberally, for instance, stressing the impulses that make drawing necessary and the way in which tactile engagement with a given surface, form, or space can be considered an act of drawing. This work places a similar emphasis on the category of painting.The title Finnish Painting proposes a strangely specific, yet also enigmatic, evocation of national identity and offers a play on words by referencing the imperative to “finish painting.” The surface is materially and formally riotous, comprised of the barely legible text of a poem whose last word is “decode”—as if acknowledging that to see, read, and understand others is always a struggle and that meaning is often fluid or open-ended. Meanwhile, the painting’s clearest feature is the signature-like name of artist Robert Ryman in the bottom right corner. Ryman, a figure associated with the emergence of Minimalism in the early 1960s, treated his signature as an important visual element within a painting’s composition, never simply as authorization of a finished canvas. Ryman is also known for a signature color (or noncolor): he makes white monochrome paintings, although sometimes the white has been layered on top of colorful, mostly or entirely obscured underpainting. Perhaps this Pope.L work reveals what might lie beneath Ryman’s white surfaces.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/229866/finnish-painting

Conflating conventional cinematic structure with avant-garde techniques, Julien subverts stereotypical portrayals of black and gay subjects, forcing viewers to question accepted representational archetypes. Produced collaboratively with Venezuela-born choreographer Javier De Frutos, The Long Road to Mazatlán is a modern cowboy story. Shot in and around San Antonio, Texas, the film captures the erotically charged interchanges between a young Hispanic man and the emotionally unavailable cowboy he pursues. Shot in lush color and layered imagery, the protagonists play out, as actors and at times as dancers, the subtle drama of the everyday, performing within carefully constructed environments. Through selected editing and the use of a three-screen installation, the artist composes a mise-en-scène that explores the social construction of masculinity within mythic landscapes of the American West.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/184186/the-long-road-to-mazatlan
usa_106,Mark Bradford,Mixed media on canvas,A Siren Beside a Ship,"Mark Bradford’s monumental abstract paintings comprise countless small fragments — often materials scavenged from storefronts, telephone poles, and billboards in the South Central neighborhood of Los Angeles, where he grew up. The artist has explained, “I love the papered ‘mosaics’ I see in the community advertising the latest latest… . [When] the billboards are nice and thick and are about to fall off … I pull down what I need to create my collages… . Like those tagged up, repainted, tagged up, sanded, and repainted walls you pass everyday on the street, my process is both reductive and additive.” Bradford is also known for redeploying hair dye and wave endpapers from his mother’s salon, where he worked on and off for many years, and more recently for using home-repair caulking to amplify ridges and depths. It is usually impossible to recognize such individual materials on his surfaces; the power of Bradford’s work is the power of cumulative materiality, at once enigmatic and evocative.The sweeping composition of A Siren beside a Ship is built up from a mix of carbon paper, caulking, and acrylic gel medium that Bradford relentlessly layered, sanded, and layered again to create a dense, suggestive texture. The surface’s striations recall rippling water and seascape paintings, which the artist has said summon for him the dark histories of conquistadors, colonization, and the transatlantic slave trade. Given this work’s title, the wavelike markings also reference the dangerously enchanting voices of the Sirens of Greek mythology, as well as the sound of a modern-day alarm, combining a sense of allure with one of urgent warning.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/225016/a-siren-beside-a-ship

Blending Cartier-Bresson’s formal rigor with an explorative openness to new subject matter, Eggleston was soon working exclusively in color, producing rich, saturated dye-transfer prints. Although the 1975 exhibition of his work was met with skepticism, it declared to an entire generation of photographers that serious art could be made in color and with unassuming subjects drawn from the artist’s own experience. In this seemingly simple study, an abstracted American palette of red, white, and blue appears in a hanging jacket whose peaked hood carries more ominous connotations.

usa_108,Hannah Johnson,"Wool, plain weave; with cut pile formed by wool yarns embroidered in looped running stitches",Bed Rug,"It is not surprising that early American textiles reflect the strong influence of European, especially English, designs and techniques. Materials were scarce and making utilitarian objects such as bedcoverings depended entirely on raw products that could be raised by a family or community. Yet indigenous forms of American needlework did develop, as can be seen in this masterful bed rug. Although the coiling tendrils of its design are reminiscent of motifs that appear in sixteenth- and seventeenth-century English textiles, their application to a bedcovering and the technique of looped running stitches embroidered through a wool support fabric are typically American. The term rugge or rugg appears in colonial inventories, where it refers to a woven yardage fabric used to make bedcovers. Such pieces were unique to the Connecticut River Valley. The information provided by the needlework contributes to the rarity of this piece: the initials H. J. refer to its maker, Hannah Johnson, the daughter of Ebenezer and Anna Johnson.

Fuller coined the term dymaxion to label his inventions that applied available technology to provide the greatest possible efficiency. In 1927 he began investigating designs that would revolutionize transportation. Fuller used existing automotive parts and boat and airplane technology to design the Dymaxion Car, which debuted to an awed public at the 1933 Century of Progress Exposition in Chicago. The aerodynamic bullet shape and lightweight aluminum chassis enabled the car to reach speeds of 120 miles per hour, and consumed thirty miles per gallon. The three-wheeled vehicle had exceptional maneuverability due to its rear-wheel drivetrain. Fuller refined the design in the 1940s, but a prototype proved prohibitively expensive to manufacture.

In Wilde’s tale, a portrait of the young and attractive Gray decays as the protagonist leads an increasingly wayward life, recording the extent of his moral corruption in paint. Having established a reputation for capturing the macabre, Albright was the ideal choice to create such a horrific image that both attracts and repulses its viewers. The portrait appeared in vivid Technicolor, within the otherwise black-and-white film, causing a sensation. When Albright’s canvas was exhibited at the Art Institute later that year, the Chicago Tribune reported that the museum “is having a heck of a time handling the crowds flocking to see his painting.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/93798/picture-of-dorian-gray

Individuals all different, all wanting different things, all knowing different things, all loving different things, all looking different… . That is what I love: the differentness.” Arbus’s appreciation for the unusual, eccentric, and extraordinary led her to photograph a range of subjects over the thirty years of her career—transvestites, giants, art philanthropists, nudists, and, as here, identical twins. No one knows how Arbus learned about a small-town Christmas party in 1967 being held for local twins and triplets, but it is in keeping with her interest in how people are who they are. Isolating these seven-year-old girls against the wall of the Knights of Columbus hall in Roselle, New Jersey, and photographing them in her typically straightforward manner, Arbus ensured close attention would be paid to the details: the matching homemade dresses (which were green but appear black), the lace stockings bunched below the knees, and the barely discernible difference in each girl’s presentation before the camera.

Josephine Logan, the donor of the prize, condemned the work’s broad, exaggerated style as too modern, and founded the conservative “Sanity in Art” movement in response.

In The Golden Wall, rectangles of varying sizes and colors direct the gaze across the picture.

Johns first glimpsed this pattern on a passing car, recalling: “I only saw it for a second, but knew immediately that I was going to use it. It had all the qualities that interest me—literalness, repetitiveness, an obsessive quality, order with dumbness, and the possibility of a complete lack of meaning.” Emphasizing the flatness of the painting, Johns’s cross-hatching is gestural without being emotive; in this sense, the technique extends his larger critique of overtly expressionist models of painting. Johns forged a new model of painterly abstraction, using a schema that is repeatable and ordered but not strictly geometric or reductive.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/118981/corpse-and-mirror-ii

The canvas of Untitled (Painting) burns with subtle variations of orange and yellow hues. The painting follows the characteristic format of Rothko’s mature work, according to which stacked rectangles of color appear to float within the boundaries of the canvas. By directly staining the fabric of the canvas with many thin washes of pigment and by paying particular attention to the edges where the fields interact, he achieved the effect of light radiating from the image itself. This technique suited his metaphysical aims: to offer painting as a doorway into purely spiritual realms, making it as immaterial and evocative as music, and to communicate directly the most essential, rawest forms of human emotion. Rothko described his art as the “elimination of all obstacles between the painter and the idea, between the idea and the observer.” In place of overt symbolism, he used color, overwhelming scale, and surface luminosity to elicit an emotive, profound response from the viewer.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/82410/untitled-painting

Every morning she was photographed naked in the same four stances to record her barely perceptible self-induced weight loss. (The photographs from each day are arranged vertically, and the entire process can be read horizontally, like a filmstrip.) Antin’s performance purposely toyed with the traditional process of Greek sculptors, who were said to find their ideal form by chipping away at a block of marble and discarding any unnecessary material.

usa_190,Joseph Cornell,Box construction,Soap Bubble Set,"A soap bubble set box (1936, Hartford, Wadsworth Atheneum ; New York 1980–82, pl. 1) was part of Cornell‘s first “theme” installation, in AIfred Barr’s exhibition Fantastic Art, Dada, Surrealism at The Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1936-37. Cornell called the installation The Elements of Natural Philosophy; it consisted of a glass showcase containing eighty-seven pieces in all, including the box itself. Cornell described this 1936 box as “a real ‘first-born‘ of the type of case that was to become my accepted milieu” (Joseph Cornell, memorandum to Hans Huth, 1953, Archives, The Art Institute of Chicago). In it the spiraling connections between the pipe and “bubbles,” which Cornell metamorphosed into planetary bodies, in this case the moon, are already present.In the present Soap Bubble Set, the white ball resembles either the moon or a bubble. The fragment of coral in the glass introduces the idea of a beach and driftwood; Cornell frequently scoured the beach for flotsam and jetsam thrown up by the tides, even finding there, it seems, clay pipes and glasses (verbal communication to the author from Elizabeth Cornell Benton, Cornell‘s sister, in 1980). Cornell acquired many of the Dutch clay pipes he used in his boxes from the New York World’s Fairs of 1939 and 1940 (Lynda Roscoe Hartigan, in New York 1980–82, p. 100). The deep-blue velvet that covers the box‘s rear wall both creates a night-sky setting for the balls/planets and hints at the proscenium setting of an old-fashioned, velvet-hung theater.This box was first shown in an exhibition William Copley organized at his Beverly Hills gallery in 1948, the entire contents of which he had bought from Cornell. The show was, in Copley’s words, an “enormous failure.” Copley attributed this to the fact that his installation transformed the gallery into one large box. Plastering the walls and ceiling with the blue-and-white catalogues and scattering clay pipes among the boxes displayed on glass shelves, he created a whole artwork, which he felt inhibited the public from entering (see Bill Copley, “Joseph Cornell,” in New York, Castelli, Feigen, Corcoran, Joseph Cornell Portfolio, 1976, exh. cat., n. pag.). Judging from the catalogue of the 1948 show, at least four Soap Bubble Sets were displayed. In the brief catalogue notes, Cornell wrote:“Soap Bubble SetsShadow boxes become poetic theatres or settings wherein are metamorphosed the elements of a childhood pastime. The fragile, shimmering globules become the shimmering but more enduring planets—a connotation of moon and tides – the association of water less subtle, as when driftwood [sic] pieces make up a proscenium to set off the dazzling white of sea-foam and billowy cloud crystalized in a pipe of fancy.”When this work was shown by Copley in 1948, it was given the subtitle Spirit Level. While the blue and the white balls on the lower shelf recall heavenly bodies, like moon and planet, the isolated blue marble on the upper shelf indeed recalls the bubble of a spirit level, a device to determine or maintain a level surface, consisting of a bubble suspended in a glass tube full of liquid. The bubble in a spirit level is highly sensitive to minute shifts of orientation, like the balls that roll freely on their glass shelves in the present box. Perhaps the idea of a spirit level was prompted in Cornell‘s mind by his anxiety about the displacement or, as he put it, the “derangement” of the objects in this construction, a concern he expressed in the two typewritten labels on the back of the box (see fig. 4). The subtitle Spirit Level may thus allude to the actions of tilting, adjusting, and straightening the box, with the constant possibility of displacing its delicately disposed contents, in what amounts to a mental as well as physical process.— Entry, Dawn Ades, Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1997, p.50-51.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/99782/soap-bubble-set

His unique merging of Impressionism with a bold, painterly realism was admired for its potency and vigor, which was seen as a healthy antidote to the more delicate styles of many American Impressionists. Afterglow also intrigued contemporary critics for its depiction of the city. Many reviewers questioned whether Lie’s gleaming view of lower Manhattan—especially the monumental buildings of the financial district—was intended as an allegory or as a commentary on American economic power and aspirations. In these readings, the glowing buildings suggest a wondrous city of gold, yet one that remains tantalizingly in the distance.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/70065/afterglow

This sketch, possibly made from the Brooklyn Bridge, takes a view of the skyline similar to the other two, yet Marin transformed the small sheet into a kind of floating fantasy.

The sky is illuminated by patches of orange and white light, outlining the ships and distant town on the horizon. Careful study of the surface of the central rock in the foreground illustrates the artist’s impressive manipulation of paint: by employing shifts in texture and shading, he was able to emphasize distinctions between sun and shadow, wet and dry, and clean and algae-covered. Inness traveled to Europe to study landscape painting with the masters of the Barbizon School, who were known for a personal style that contrasted with the grandiose Hudson River School in America.

Grey Diamond contains many principles of Neo-Plasticism: a lack of depth, the elimination of all representational forms, and carefully balanced color.

Moholy had already photographed the Eiffel Tower in Paris from below, looking up through the tower’s soaring girders. In Berlin, however, Moholy turned his camera around and pointed it straight down at the ground. This plunging perspective showed off the spectacular narrowness of the Radio Tower, finished in 1926, which rose vertiginously to a height of 450 feet from a base seven times smaller than that of its Parisian predecessor (which opened in 1889). Moholy attached exceptional importance to this, his boldest image: he hung it just above his name in a room devoted to his work at the Berlin showing of Film und Foto, a mammoth traveling exhibition that he had helped to prepare. Moholy also chose this view and one other to offer Julien Levy, the pioneering art dealer, when Levy visited him in Berlin in 1930.

Referred to as a “water glass” or “sponge glass,” this device was used to stabilize the surface of moving water in order to improve visibility. Homer may have been attracted to the subject because it draws attention to the constantly moving surface of the water as well as its transparency, aspects of the sea that especially intrigued him in the Bahamas. Like The Sponge Diver (1898/99; MFA Boston), this work originally had more visible red washes in the water, hinting at the pink coral beneath the surface. While these areas have faded, the fluid strokes of darker blue over layers of transparent turquoise are effective in suggesting the play of light, both direct and reflected, over water.Homer depicted light shimmering on the ocean using watercolor paper with a heavy twill texture in The Water Fan. The diagonal pattern of the sheet, which runs from top right to lower left, was imparted during manufacture by the papermaker’s woven wire screen that supported the paper pulp during sheet formation.

Marsh filled every inch of the composition with details, ranging from architectural elements to signs and text. Marsh used tempera—a medium that dries quickly—almost as if he were drawing. He added successive layers of muted colors resulting in a mottled, uneven surface that emphasizes the gritty nature of this world.

usa_226,Andy Warhol,Color screenprint on cream card,Marilyn Monroe (Marilyn),"Due in part to his experience as a highly successful commercial illustrator in the 1950s, Andy Warhol was as much businessman as artist and understood the value of mass production and distribution. By the early 1960s, screenprinting had become the favored medium for commercial printing jobs, such as labels and signage. It was used to quickly reproduce photographic images on almost any flat surface. By 1962 Warhol had begun using it to put repeated images on his canvases—images that he had previously painted painstakingly by hand. Because Warhol had not finessed the process, his printing “mistakes” became a signature. In 1967 he began publishing limited-edition print portfolios in his studio under the aegis of Factory Editions.Marilyn was the first such portfolio, consisting of ten images made from the same 1953 publicity photograph of Marilyn Monroe in the film Niagara, which Warhol transformed with intentionally off-register printing and garish combinations of psychedelic colors. Daylight fluorescent colors, better known as Day-Glo colors, were invented in the 1930s, and by the 1960s had become integral to the graphic vocabulary of Pop art. While a conventional bright color reflects 80 to 90 percent of its color, a Day-Glo color appears to reflect more than 300 percent of its color. It is no wonder then that art historian Robert Rosenblum observed that Marilyn’s face “seems perpetually illuminated by the afterimage of a flashbulb.” With this method and presentation, Warhol and his work became synonymous with Pop Art.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/150044/marilyn-monroe-marilyn

Color video, sound (projection); 62 min. loop",The Reflecting Pool: Collected Works,"For over thirty years, Bill Viola has created single-channel videos as well as sound and video installations that focus on spirituality and explore multiple levels of human consciousness. In constructing these works, the artist draws from his extensive study of Eastern and Western art, philosophy, and religion. He also consistently deploys cutting-edge technologies, investigating new ways to manipulate viewers’ percep-tion. Both the videos in The Reflecting Pool and the installation Reasons for Knocking at an Empty House are important early works that foreshadow Viola’s later creations, combining philosophic inquiry with captivating physical environments.The Reflecting Pool is a series comprising five individual videos, including Moonblood, that offer a collective meditation on the various stages in an individual life. The first work, also titled The Reflecting Pool, demonstrates the shift from stillness to motion as a fixed camera captures a man approaching a pool of water through trees and lush foliage. The only sounds are those of the branches rustling and the water rippling. The man momentarily stands before the pool before jumping into the air. As he reaches the crest of his jump, he is frozen in space while the water beneath him continues to undulate. There is a fleeting reflection of other people walking around the pool, although no one can be seen doing so. After a series of similar perceptual and temporal fragmentations, the man’s image fades, leaving only the pool. The final moments of the video are evocative of baptism, as a nude man emerges from the water and retreats into the woods.In this series, Viola aims to deconstruct viewers’ concepts of time and memory, divorcing images from their subjective meaning and reconnecting them to universal truths. This process of fostering self-awareness is an undercurrent of the artist’s practice. He has remarked, “There’s another dimension that you just know is there, that can be a source of real knowledge, and the quest for connecting with that and identifying that is the whole impetus for me to cultivate these experiences and to make my work.”In both The Reflecting Pool and Reasons for Knocking at an Empty House, the artist urges viewers to become active participants. Of his work, Viola stated, “You’re a part of it. It’s not something that’s just a fixed projection from the past.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/108765/the-reflecting-pool-collected-works

Strand made several radical choices in this work: he abandoned the traditional, upright perspective of the photograph; caused the table to appear tipped, as if to suspend its utilitarian function; deployed shadows to create powerful compositional diagonals; and suggested objectivity in the crispness of his negative and print. When Porch Shadows appeared in the final issue of Camera Work, it was a clear signal of a new aesthetic. As Strand wrote, true modernists should avoid all “tricks of process or manipulation” to celebrate photography’s inherent qualities as art.For more on the Alfred Stieglitz collection at the Art Institute, along with in-depth object information, please visit the website: The Alfred Stieglitz Collection.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/66878/porch-shadows

Although she enjoyed her trip to Canada, and returned again that year, ultimately O’Keeffe preferred the New Mexican landscape, specifically its brilliant sunshine.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/2895/green-mountains-canada

He invited friends to produce small pieces that could be smuggled into the exhibition in his cabinet-shaped construction. A painting by his former wife, artist Susan Weil, appears behind the right door, and a flag composition by Jasper Johns once sat behind the left door. (It went missing in 1965 and was replaced at Rauschenberg’s invitation with a facsimile by the artist Sturtevant.) The work also includes a Judy Garland autograph, an image of Abraham Lincoln, and a postcard of grazing cows, among other items.

usa_241,Georgia O'Keeffe,Oil on canvas,Red and Pink Rocks and Teeth,"Georgia O’Keeffe was fascinated by the animal bones, weathered and worn, that she found in the desert in New Mexico. In Red and Pink Rocks and Teeth she presented a jawbone alongside two stacked rocks that appear both monumental and indeterminate. The smooth, rounded forms of the red and pink rocks appear in enigmatic relation to one another, as the red pebble appears to recede from the picture plane even though it must be perched on top of the pink stone. Their abstracted forms and warm colors contrast sharply with the bleached, angular teeth and hard, cracked appearance of the jawbone and together construct a modern trompe l’oeil that questions the nature of representation and perception.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/84742/red-and-pink-rocks-and-teeth

usa_243,John Steuart Curry,Oil on canvas,Hogs Killing a Snake,"Along with Grant Wood and Thomas Hart Benton, John Steuart Curry attained significant fame as one of the three most important Regionalist painters of the 1930s. In 1941 Wood wrote about Curry: “It was action he loved most to interpret: the lunge through space, the split second before the kill, the suspended moment before the storm strikes.” Hogs Killing a Snake reveals his fascination with the violence of nature and the struggle for survival. Curry deliberately constructed the dynamic composition to heighten the vitality of his subject; the hogs converge from all angles upon the writhing snake, giving a sense of violent motion. Curry accentuated the vigor of the composition with his painting technique, using short, choppy brushstrokes and even scratching on the surface of the paint to suggest the bristling hair on the hogs’ backs. Although the subject was ostensibly drawn from a childhood experience, the painting transcends mere realism to become nearly epic.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/60510/hogs-killing-a-snake

The striking canvas suggests the mystifying environs of a dreamscape, reflecting Sage’s fascination with the unconscious. In the mid-1930s, the artist lived in Paris and worked alongside French Surrealists, including Yves Tanguy, whom she married in 1940 after moving to New York at the outbreak of World War II.

The faces, makeup, and hairstyles of Currin’s women, however, are always borrowed from contemporary magazines and advertisements. Ultimately, the artist’s fusion of high and low source materials produces distinctly beautiful, often disturbing, works that are equal parts homage and parody. This painting is a direct quotation of Annibale Carracci’s Dead Christ (c. 1584; Staatsgalerie Stuttgart).",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/158466/nude-on-a-table
usa_246,Yves Tanguy,Oil on canvas,The Rapidity of Sleep,"This painting exemplifies Yves Tanguy’s late style, especially as he practiced it after his move to the United States in 1939, where he married the American painter Kay Sage. The forms have become harder and more sculptural, resembling strangely shaped stones, rather than the amorphous creatures of his earlier paintings, and echoing more clearly the prehistoric stones—the dolmens and menhirs—of Tanguy’s native Brittany. Color is also intensified, as the artist makes more generous use of the orange-red and blue found only spottily in earlier works, such as his 1928 screen. The arrangement, size, and shape of these forms has become more varied, from the regimented clustering of forms on the right to the horizontal scattering of forms on the left and in the background. The viewer is also brought visually closer to the scene through the cropping of forms in the foreground.The title of the painting (inscribed on the back as La Rapidite des sommeils) works in conjunction with the image to heighten its enigma and mystery, as in the works of Giorgio de Chirico and Rene Magritte. Perhaps the title refers to the onset of sleep, or to the different stages of sleep, as the French use of the plural “sommeils” seems to suggest. This interpretation seems to find a visual equivalent in the progression from congested, active foreground to sparse, quiet back-ground, from the thicket of vertical forms on the right to the more relaxed rhythm of horizontal forms extending into the distance. In the middle ground, at left, is an unusual configuration that seems particularly evocative in relation to the title. A horizontal form reminiscent of a sleeping figure lies, as in a bed or coffin, within the rectangular space defined by a rocklike border. Is Tanguy referring to the sleep that ushers in the dream-world of his landscapes or to the ultimate sleep, the sleep of death? The mood of the picture hovers uncertainly between the ominous and the contemplative, between lower and upper halves, engendering a desire to traverse the inhospitable foreground to reach the soothing, misty reaches of the background. Given the date of the work, at the end of World War II, one also wonders whether there is embedded in this work something of the emotional tenor of the times, a yearning for a peace that would transcend recent history.—Entry, Margherita Andreotti, Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies, Vol. 20, No. 2, The Joseph Winterbotham Collection at The Art Institute of Chicago (1994), p. 176-177.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/54745/the-rapidity-of-sleep

In the poem, Elaine dies of a broken heart after being spurned by Sir Lancelot; Rosenthal’s painting depicts Elaine’s postmortem voyage from Astolat to Camelot: “In her right hand the lily, in her left / The letter—all her bright hair streaming down.” Rosenthal’s artistic choices reflect the influence of the Pre-Raphaelites, a group of English artists who favored highly naturalistic details, richly colored surfaces, and subjects drawn from medieval literary sources. After it was purchased by an American patron, Rosenthal’s work sparked Elaine hysteria: clubs were formed in her honor, dirges and waltzes were composed, and copies of Idylls of the King sold out in bookstores.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/72320/elaine

Andre invites viewers to walk upon his sculptures so that they can register, on a sensory level, the feel of different materials (such as steel and aluminum) and the distinction between standing in the middle of a sculpture and remaining outside of its boundaries. Originally exhibited as part of a single installation entitled 37 Pieces of Work, at the Solomon R.

His body is so fine and dear I could work almost without end from him.” So wrote Marsden Hartley about Lionel Daigle, a French-Canadian boxer from the town of Madawaska, Maine, who modeled for a series of paintings by the artist. A Maine native himself, Hartley drew upon local types at this time to create a mythic view of the state’s inhabitants as rugged individualists. Hartley delighted in painting the man’s body, which allowed him to express his own sexuality. He emphasized Daigle’s strong physique, exaggerating his anatomy and originally painting him nude (subsequently adding the brief covering). Ironically, critics in the 1940s applauded the work as a display of heteronormative masculinity.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/70028/madawaska-acadian-light-heavy

Melchers portrayed the pair with vivid intensity, contrasting the mother’s direct gaze with the charming appeal of the baby’s chubby face. The rapid brushwork used to describe the clothing and the swaddling blanket contributes to the freshness of his depiction.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, he turned his attention away from painting, instead focusing on sculpture, printmaking, and drawing. In 1975, at the age of 71, de Kooning began one of the most productive periods of painting in his career, quickly completing 20 new, large canvases within 6 months. Untitled XI belongs to this series, which was, with a few exceptions, untitled and chronologically numbered. Moving away from tightly organized compositions, de Kooning used free-flowing brushwork and softened, sensuous hues to liberate form.

The artist often situated enigmatic people in bleak landscapes, and he aligned these morose visualizations with his experiences as an African American man: “Unconsciously it has a lot to do with a sense of alienation … and in all blacks there is an awareness of their isolation from the mainstream of society.” Anonymous and disconnected from one another, the figures face an austere existence—evocative, perhaps, of the human condition amid a turbulent modern world.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/212760/desert-forms

Hitchcock spent much of his life in Holland, and his work synthesizes elements of several European art movements.

With their lyrical brushwork and biometric shapes, these works marked the artist’s shift from a representational or figurative drawing style to the new gestural tendencies of the New York School.

By 1947 he abandoned such suggestive imagery and began working exclusively with how ideas of color, light, and space could be manifested in paint. Number 19 follows the characteristic format of his transitional canvases, in which loosely defined shapes hover against a thinly brushed background. Color had become a defining force for Rothko, as had the atmospheric—even ghostly—layering of oil paint, which would lead to his signature color-field of the 1950s.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/6010/number-19

Pollock became engaged in an intense dialogue with the work of the Mexican muralists José Clemente Orozco and David Alfaro Siqueiros; he was inspired by their social commitment and use of primitive, archetypal imagery. The expressionistic style and oblong format of Untitled recall Orozco’s murals at Pomona and Dartmouth Colleges, which Pollock had seen firsthand.

Although Baer’s work from this period relied on the simple geometric forms and serial imagery of much Minimal and Conceptual art of the time, her practice was distinguished by her unwavering commitment to the medium of paint on canvas. Baer was primarily interested in using painting as a vehicle for exploring the complexities of visual perception.

The figures in this work are only partly freed from the marble, a technique that emphasizes the mass and outline of the stone.

The artist applied bold streaks of pigment using fluid brushstrokes, drawing attention to the paint’s texture.

Without a car, and confined mostly to town, Edward found his subject matter where he could. Conveniently, their spare, impersonal hotel room provided him with the detached atmosphere he sought in all his work. In this painting, Edward invisibly observed Jo pinched between chair and dresser, a book propped on her folded knees, absorbed in the text. Her reflection reveals nothing but a mass of black hair. She’s bookish but unreadable. The view places us on the intimate perch of the room’s bed, giving the work a voyeuristic feeling.

The title refers to fields of lettuce, spinach, and mustard that the young artist viewed from a train while speeding through the French countryside—this perceptual blur here pushed to the extreme of a flat, pristine monochrome.

Here he focused on three women who sit together at the central table of a popular Italian restaurant in New York City. By showing the women celebrating a night out on the town, the artist emphasized their newfound freedom to socialize in public spaces without the need for male escorts. Although he indicated their working-class status through their “unladylike” gestures—legs wrapped around their chairs and pinkies flared in the air—Sloan did not cast judgment on the women’s relaxed behavior.

He was introduced to European and American modernists, including Jean (Hans) Arp and John Cage, both of whom had an enormous impact on Kelly’s development and the creation of the Study for “Cité”. Cage and Arp encouraged Kelly to involve chance in his compositional arrangements, as Arp had done in Dadaist collages as early as 1916, and as Cage began to do in musical compositions in 1951.Produced in 1951, Study for “Cité”: Brushstrokes Cut into Twenty Squares and Arranged by Chance was the basis for Cité, a large-scale polyptych painting, and served as the foundation for a period of Kelly’s career in which his work was characterized by gridded compositions developed at random through a collage process.The inspiration for Cité’ came to Kelly in a dream in June 1951, while he was staying at the Cité Universitaire, a large complex of buildings that included dormitories for the University of Paris. He wrote, “I dreamt that I was working on a scaffold … creating an immense mural composed of square panels on which we painted black bands with huge brushes.” [1] With the dream came an “idea for a very grand work, something to be used with architecture… . This dream is something I have been waiting for.” [2] To replicate the qualities of the dream painting, Kelly produced Study for “Cité”: Brushstrokes Cut into Twenty Squares and Arranged by Chance. Kelly brushed ink strokes across a sheet of paper, cut the resulting drawing into twenty squares, and randomly recomposed the drawing by shuffling the squares before he glued them onto a support in a grid pattern, retaining the horizontal orientation of the brushstrokes. Cité, [3] now at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, replicates Study for “Cité” as a polyptych painting.[1] Kelly, Ellsworth, Jack Cowart, Alfred Pacquement, and Yve-Alain Bois, Ellsworth Kelly: The Years in France, 1948–1954 (National Gallery of Art, 1992), p. 190.[2] Bois, Yve-Alain, and Ellsworth Kelly, Ellsworth Kelly: The Early Drawings, 1948–1955 (Harvard University Art Museums, 1999), p. 24.[3] 148.59 cm × 179.71 cm × 5.08 cm",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/155990/study-for-cite-brushstrokes-cut-into-twenty-squares-and-arranged-by-chance

Their symbolic tools—spindle, distaff, and shears—rest in the foreground, emphasizing the Fates’ decisive role in matters of life and death.

This work is based on a scene in Homer’s The Odyssey, in which Odysseus finally returns home to find that he has been presumed dead and that suitors have been trying to take Penelope, his wife, as theirs. Disguised as a pauper, Odysseus convinces Penelope that she should hold a contest to see which of the many suitors can manage her husband’s bow. Through this competition he regains her hand in marriage.In making this collage, Bearden sought to draw a link between Odysseus’s struggles and those of all African Americans. Bearden was the leader of “Spiral,” a group of artists based in Harlem committed to the advancement of African Americans during the Civil Rights movement. Benin gained independence from French rule in 1960, less than twenty years before this collage was made. By making the faces of the characters black instead of white as in the original fresco, Bearden endeavored to draw comparisons between the struggles of the Benin people and African Americans, and used the Greek epic to underscore the commonalities of all humans.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/93903/the-return-of-odysseus-homage-to-pinturicchio-and-benin

Although the point of departure for her pieces is literal—she always works from casts of live models—the figure, with its fetal pose and exposed spine, becomes a primal emblem that engages viewers in issues of individual and collective health and disease, heroization and victimization, and life and death (particularly because of the dual potential of human blood in the era of AIDS).",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/122231/blood-pool

For After Egon Schiele, the artist photographed reproductions of eighteen self-portraits by the early 20th-century Austrian painter Egon Schiele.She did not alter the original images but recontextualized them through the act of appropriation. The finishedwork is at once a copy and an original, authored anew by Levine. Commenting on the choice for these particular selfportraits by Schiele, she explained, “There is something in his eroticism that strikes a chord.

usa_312,Winslow Homer,"Transparent watercolor, with touches of opaque watercolor and traces of blotting, over graphite, on moderately thick, moderately textured, ivory wove paper (lower edge trimmed)",The Gulf Stream,"Homer’s exploration of life and death in the tropics found ultimate expression in his oil painting The Gulf Stream painted at Prout’s Neck following his return from the Bahamas. A group of four watercolors documents the evolution of this terrifying seascape, which details the plight of a solitary black man, adrift in stormy seas on a broken boat and encircled by a school of aggressive requiem sharks. In early 1885, on his first trip to the Bahamas, Homer had painted Shark Fishing which depicts two fishermen controlling a hooked shark that struggles, mouth open, in the immediate foreground. On this same trip, the artist executed a similar subject, Sharks (The Derelict). In this work, an unmanned wooden boat, broken-masted and taking on water, is under attack by at least three large, circling animals. The fact that the boat is empty leaves the viewer to wonder if the worst has already happened.Homer’s 1898 voyage to the Bahamas must have reminded him of these works, suggesting the idea for his next major painting. Either in Nassau, or more likely after he returned to Prout’s Neck, he developed the theme in two watercolors. One is Study for “The Gulf Stream”, a detailed view of the bow of the derelict boat that corresponds closely to the final painting. In the work, the artist trimmed a horizontal sheet into a vertical format and filled it nearly to the top with churning waves. In the Art Institute’s watercolor study The Gulf Stream, Homer positioned the shark so that it appears to swim over the submerged side of the boat. It is probable that he painted this work in his Prout’s Neck studio, where he would have been able to refer to the studies from 1885. He trimmed the bottom of The Gulf Stream sheet, forcing the belly of the shark right up against the picture plane. In both this watercolor and in the finished painting, the impassive (or dazed) expression of the castaway and his surprisingly relaxed (or resigned) pose imbue the subject with ambiguity.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16794/the-gulf-stream

They change size and color with every passing cloud and with the passing of every hour and season.” Higgins studied and taught at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.

Often featuring his wife, family, and friends as portrait subjects, his works emphasize the flatness of the picture plane while remaining determinedly realistic, resulting in highly stylized images that appear at once specific and generic.

Although the artist’s reverent handling of color and light in this image has often been linked to his interest in Swedenborgian spirituality, it also relates to his admiration for this particular expanse of the American landscape. During the mid-19th century, the Catskill Mountain range was America’s premiere tourist site.

It was the seat of the German Seventh-day Baptists, an early American religious colony that had disbanded in 1934 and was being restored as a historic landmark when Wyeth visited with his aunt Elizabeth in 1949. Wyeth’s early studies portrayed Elizabeth in the room, but he eliminated her figure and increasingly abstracted the space to focus on the play of light against the muted brown walls. The bird, a chalk sculpture of the type produced by residents of the Ephrata Cloister, stands as a slightly surreal evocation of the history of the colony and Elizabeth’s one-time presence in the scene.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/26083/the-cloisters

As director of the German Bauhaus during the early 1930s, Mies formalized his notion of unifying form with function. In 1937 he immigrated to Chicago, where he became director of the School of Architecture at the Armour Institute of Technology (later the Illinois Institute of Technology). His legacy is still felt in the school’s program of stressing the fundamentals, materials, and function of architectural design.

In contrast to Newman and Rothko, who usually applied paint thinly and uniformly, Still used a palette knife, creating textural effects that give the surface a complex, nearly sculptural sense of materiality. Named after the years of its creation, 1951–52 is a rare, nearly all-black work in the artist’s oeuvre. A vertical white line to the right of center and a thin streak of red-orange along the left side provide the sole interruptions in the black field.

usa_337,Joseph Cornell,Box construction with blue glass,Homage to the Romantic Ballet,"Cornell began to make souvenir cases, such as this one, and other objects in tribute to the Romantic ballet in 1940, having begun to collect books, prints, letters, and photographs in the late 1930s. As Lynda Hartigan has pointed out, Cornell was un happy at “not being able to find more poignantly evocative, colorful trifles about its [the Romantic ballet’s] ballerinas,” and used his creations “to fill that void” (Washington, D.C., National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Joseph Cornell: An Exploration of Sources, 1982–83, exh. cat. by Lynda Roscoe Hartigan, p. 36).Cornell’s infatuation with the great ballet dancers of the past seems to have been no less intense than his devotion to ballerinas of his own time, like Tamara Toumanova. He collected material on Fanny Cerrito, Fanny Elssler, Lucile Grahn, and the subject of this box, Marie Taglioni. These were the pioneers and stars of the new style of dancing on point in the 1830s and 1840s, which accompanied a dramatic change in ballet, as “mythological and classical themes gave way to plots based on dramatic love themes, fairy tales, and folk legends—themes that treated the subject on two planes: the actual and the ideal, the flesh and the spirit, the real and the fantastic” (Christine Hennessey, “Joseph Cornell: A Balletomane,” Archives of American Art Journal 23, 3 [1983], p. 8).Cornell, in fact, studied the entire cultural milieu of the Romantic ballet: that in-between world represented by the stage in the nineteenth century, where social and sexual taboos and restrictions were loosened; a world frequented by artists and writers, whose connoisseurs and balletomanes included such figures as the poet Theophile Gautier and the writer Hans Christian Andersen. Cornell devoted an entire issue of Dance Index (4 [Sept. 1945]) to Andersen, including a scenario, “Theatre of Hans Christian Andersen,” for a miniature theater presentation based on his fairy tales. “The Little Mermaid,” for example, is represented in this scenario by the Shadow Dance from Ondine, “the ballet created by Fanny Cerrito a hundred years ago,” Cornell explained, “which was based vaguely upon the Andersen tale” (ibid., p. 158).Paper cutouts for miniature shadow theater by Andersen himself are reproduced in this issue (ibid., pp. 138, 144–45, 155–57) with Cornell’s own comments: “And little did these same huge hands dream they were creating in the paper silhouettes priceless pieces of collector’s varia—to enter a precious realm where the white baroque ballerinas invite a paperdoll Taglioni in rainbow costumes to join in their dance to the envious gaze of tiny twin Ellslers [sic] quivering in glass prisons” (ibid., p. 139).The legend inscribed in the lid of Homage to the Romantic Ballet is based on an adventure told by Marie Taglioni of her encounter with a Russian highwayman who blackmailed her into dancing on rugs spread over the muddy road—a story Cornell came across in J. Vandham’s An Englishman in Paris (New York, 1892; see Hennessey, p. 9). The story became entangled in Cornell’s imagination with the chance sight of a load of ice spilling from a truck at New York’s Grand Central Station, which, he said, “evoked in the most graphic manner the faerie of the Romantic ballet” (Cornell Papers, AAA, reel 1066; cited in Hennessey, p. 9). Cornell announced in the October 1940 issue of View (“As We Go to Press,” View 1, 2 [Oct. 1940], p. 4) that he was working on “a box of ice-cubes encased in sumptuous blue velvet … for … Taglioni”; this was the version known as Taglioni’s Jewel Casket now in The Museum of Modern Art, New York (New York 1980 –82, no. 8 7, ill.), which was included in Cornell’s Exhibition of Objects at the Julien Levy Gallery, New York, in December of 1940. One of the categories or work noted on the exhibition announcement was “Homage to the Romantic Ballet: Marie Taglioni, Fanny Cerrito, Calotta Grisi, etc.” The casket was purchased from this exhibition by James Thrall Soby, who gave it to The Museum or Modern Art in 1953. Taglioni‘s Jewel Casket has two necklaces, one of which is suspended inside the lid, in addition to sparkling glass gems, purchased from Woolworth’s. In both boxes Cornell pasted the legend of the encounter between the ballerina and the highwayman, typed in light letters on a dark ground, so that even the text‘s appearance contributes to the atmosphere of a moonlit night. Cornell’s version of the event, as Dickran Tashjian suggested, contains a “barely suppressed eroticism,” which points to the “sexual charge of his ballet imagery” (Tashjian 1992, p. 113).The evidence provided by the box itself indicate that Homage to the Romantic Ballet originally included twelve smaller cubes. There are in fact markings on the velvet lining in the lid of the box suggesting that it once contained twelve 1-inch cubes, and the lid cannot be closed while the present 1 1/4-inch cubes are on the glass because they are too large.— Entry, Dawn Ades, Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1997, p. 45-47.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/99775/homage-to-the-romantic-ballet

usa_341,Janine Antoni,"Color video, sound (projection); 9:36 min. loop Edition number three of five",Touch,"Since the 1990s, New York–based artist Janine Antoni has established an international reputation with labor-intensive projects in a wide range of media. She incorporates both art history and personal exploration, investigating the ways in which contemporary definitions of aesthetics and art making are connected to issues of gender identity and sexuality. Inspired by the feminist artists of the 1970s, she reframes and subverts art-historical and societal conventions surrounding women and beauty.Antoni creates intimate, ritualized encounters between her chosen materials and her own body, which has become her essential tool. In Touch, which was commissioned for SITE Santa Fe in 2002, she balances on a tightrope, a skill she has sought to master. Here, on the beach in front of her childhood home on Grand Bahama Island, the artist walks a line that is parallel to the horizon. Dressed in sky blue, she enters the landscape from outside the frame. When the wire dips under her weight, it appears to touch the horizon, creating the illusion that she is walking on the water. Like many of Antoni’s works, Touch records a relationship—a moment of contact—and reveals the artist’s longing to bridge the gaps between herself and viewers, between her work and art history.Antoni begins with an idea of artistic process that dictates the final result and meaning. The idea of Touch derives from Moor (2001), a work in which the artist created a rope out of her and her friends’ belongings; the artist has said that while she intends to walk it, she also questions the impulse. Touch depicts a literal balancing act in order to suggest the state of perfection that many people strive for, including herself. Antoni has said, “Touch is about that moment or that desire to walk on the horizon,” a location that represents hope and the future. She explained that she wants to walk in “this impossible place, a place that cannot be pinpointed … on the line of my vision, or along the edge of my imagination.” Since the viewer’s involvement is a crucial element in her work, Antoni asks us to imagine ourselves in her situation and contemplate the meaning of the horizon when she is absent from the scene. As the artist teeters but never falls, she accepts and almost embraces a state of imbalance.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/184183/touch

Resulting in what he called “a period of grieving followed by an incredible lightness and freedom” the event proved pivotal in directing the artist’s subsequent work. One year later, Puryear began a series of sculptures around the themes of movement and shelter. Sanctuary embodies what he described as “mobility with a kind of escapism, of survival through flight.” The sculpture appears to be in a state of arrested motion. This whimsical and sophisticated work reconciles a longing for stability with a need for change. By pairing the wild tree saplings with a carefully fashioned shelter, Puryear celebrated the beauty of wood in both its natural and refined states.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/99512/sanctuary

Newman took this rarely exhibited photograph of an African American policeman standing in front of a store window while he was on assignment for Life magazine in Ithaca, New York. In contrast to his iconic, highly constructed portraits, this picture exemplifies a more spontaneous approach in vivid color.

Benson is best known for his outdoor figural compositions, which often feature his wife or children in sun-filled, breezy landscapes. Rainy Day, in contrast, is a study of the subtler effects of interior light. The artist captured the soft, filtered light emanating from the left and embers glowing at far right. Benson was one of a number of late-19th-century artists who painted scenes of contemplative women in interiors, sometimes engaged in activities like sewing or reading, suggesting a cultural link between domesticity and femininity.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/64479/rainy-day

We might try to read this painting in order, letter by letter, from top left to bottom right.

Around 1949 he began to make black-and-white canvases such as Painting, which, while abstract, continue to suggest the invigorating energy of urban street life. The artist’s preparation for his paintings included making numerous sketches on newspaper or telephone-book pages. He then translated a small-scale drawing onto canvas, as, what he called, “strokes expanding as entities in themselves.” Utilizing housepainters’ brushes, Kline tacked his canvases to a wood panel in order to obtain the hard surface that he needed to paint his world of eternally colliding forces. Though the many visible drip marks imply a quick, spontaneous execution, the artist returned to this work several times over a two-month period to refine and strengthen its rhythm and spacing.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/102581/painting

De la nada vida a la nada muerte is the largest of his Running V paintings—a set of large, monochromatic striped pictures whose titles derive from colloquial Spanish expressions. The length and mellifluous sound of this work’s title, which literally means “From life nothing to death nothing,” coincides with the rising and falling visual cadences of the painting. The two-dimensional surface, which appears as if it might continue into infinity, consists of 20 parallel lines and seems to alternately project from and recede into the wall. Although Stella’s rigorously calibrated surface, immaculate execution, and use of monochromatic gold pigment temper this painting, they barely constrain its kinetic exuberance.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/25671/de-la-nada-vida-a-la-nada-muerte

Clark’s scene is in the tradition of the urban realism of the French Impressionists, recalling such pictures as Claude Monet’s Arrival of the Normandy Train, Gare Saint-Lazare.

Quidor’s Rip Van Winkle depicts the moment that Rip, awake after his 20-year sleep in the Catskill Mountains, confronts the suspicious townsfolk who do not recognize their long-lost neighbor. Unlike many portrayals of Rip Van Winkle that emphasize his age and confusion, Quidor’s version casts Rip as strong and defiant.

usa_369,Richard Artschwager,Formica on wood,Table with Pink Tablecloth,"Richard Artschwager’s work defies categorization, yet it often combines elements of both Pop Art and Minimalism. An early example of his “furniture surrogates,” which draw upon his experience as the owner of a successful carpentry and furniture-design business, Table with Pink Tablecloth was exhibited— along with other compact, geometric masses wrapped with formica “pictures” so that they resemble domestic items—in his first solo show at the Leo Castelli Gallery, New York, in 1965. Artschwager described this work as “the way a table with a tablecloth is in a painting, in a still life—a three-dimensional still life.” Too short to be useful as a piece of furniture, this translation of a Parsons table depicts a solid form as both mass and void and attempts to reveal the levels of deception involved in pictorial illusionism.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/146901/table-with-pink-tablecloth

He modeled Woman (Elevation) after Isabel Dutaud Nagle, whom he married in 1917, telling her, “I want to create a miracle with it… as great as you.” Although it definitely evokes his subject’s appearance, this sculpture represents Lachaise’s first full-scale expression of the idealized female form that would come to dominate his art. The figure’s long legs support a voluptuous torso that recalls ancient fertility goddesses and a disproportionally small waist that accentuates her ample hips and breasts. Modernists like Lachaise were fascinated by preclassical art because they believed it possessed a primitive vitality absent from later art forms.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/58839/woman-elevation
usa_371,John McCracken,"Wood, fiberglass and lacquer",Red Plank,"John McCracken was a pioneering figure of West Coast Minimalism in the 1960s, when many California artists were concerned with issues of light and color. Having begun his career as a painter, he moved toward a more object-based aesthetic, making abstract works in the form of basic geometric shapes such as cubes or quadratic volumes. In 1966 he developed what became his signature sculptural forms: tall, leaning planks made of wood, coated in fiberglass, and then painted with a highly finished lacquer. Striking in their monolithic simplicity and characterized by pure, monochromatic surfaces, McCracken’s handcrafted “planks,” which rest on the floor and lean against the wall, successfully blur the boundary between painting and sculpture.John McCracken is considered a Minimalist sculptor with a singularly spiritual bent. He lacquered basic geometric volumes to lustrous effect, and California car culture often motivated his color choices (cars were “mobile color chips,” he once said), but he strove to make objects that were also “hallucinatory” or “other-wordly.” From 1966 forward McCracken’s signature form was the vividly monochrome “plank,” of which Red Plank is a prime example—stately, monolithic, yet leaning casually against the gallery wall.These sleek sculptures exist “between two worlds,” the artist explained, “the floor representing the physical world of standing objects, trees, cars, buildings, human bodies … and the wall representing the world of the imagination, illusionist painting space, [and] human mental space.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/33775/red-plank

Among them was Piet Mondrian, the De Stijl painter who was becoming known for his geometric abstractions. Mondrian invited the young photographer to his studio in early 1926. As Kertész recalled years later:“I went to his studio and instinctively tried to capture in my photographs the spirit of his paintings. He simplified, simplified, simplified. The studio with its symmetry dictated the composition. He had a vase with a flower, but the flower was artificial. It was colored by him with the right color to match the studio.”Although Mondrian imposed rigid geometric order on everything in the apartment, Kertész found deviations in the curves of the staircase, vase, and the round boater hat hanging on the rack. (The hat belonged to the photographer’s friend Michel Seuphor, a painter and writer who authored a book on Mondrian, who had accompanied Kertész to the studio.) This photograph has become one of Kertész’s most famous, although it was not published until 1943.

Their art added heat to Pop Art’s cool aesthetic. Mid American, an early painting that Paschke reworked several times, exemplifies the artist’s characteristic style, which utilized luminous, electric colors and fantastic imagery, yet remained rooted in a gritty realism. The confrontational, satin-robed athlete appears playfully otherworldly, with enlarged wing-tipped spats—a significant precursor to Paschke’s later shoe paintings—that emerge like butterfly wings behind his shoulders. The inscription on his shorts, Our Cover—like the tattoo on his chest, the mask on his face, the baseball mitts that float next to him, and his athletic attire—suggests the social markings used to conceal, protect, and layer a middleclass, middle-American identity.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/34149/mid-american

Nauman was a key figure in the experimental film and video movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s with such works as Dance or Exercise Around the Perimeter of a Square (Square Dance). After 1973, film and video become conspicuously absent from his work, replaced largely by language-based neon sculptures. He returned to video more than a decade later, with Good Boy Bad Boy. Of this decision, the artist recalled, “I think it’s because I had this information that I didn’t want to put into a neon sign… . I had thought about presenting it as a performance, but I have never felt comfortable with performance. And so video seemed to be a way to do it.” Conceived as a didactic moral statement, the installation employs two actors, Joan Lancaster and Tucker Smallwood, who are presented in close-up, like newscasters, on two separate monitors. Each recites a one-hundred-line commentary on the human condition that includes passages such as “I was a good boy/You were a good boy/We were good boys” and “I hate/You hate/We hate/This is hating.” Directly confronting the viewer, they deliver each repetition with increased emotional intensity, shifting in and out of sync with one another.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/146915/good-boy-bad-boy

These paintings, for example, refer to Mount Parnassus, the fabled home of Apollo and the Muses, which became known as the center of poetry, music, and learning in ancient Greece. These early paintings mix regular, system-based forms, numbers, and grids together with irregular, nature-based pictograms and suggestive or intuitive references to corporeal processes—sexual and otherwise. These are aspects of a general practice in which Twombly juxtaposes such marks to connote the dualities of mind and body. In their exuberant scale and color, the artist’s works of 1961 also reflect his response to the great architectural spaces of Rome, embracing the city’s grandeur and decadence in its ancient, Baroque, and modern incarnations.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/186050/the-second-part-of-the-return-from-parnassus

The Homosassa River, on the gulf side of the state, was home to many fish species and supported a lush wildlife habitat. It was in Homosassa that Homer painted his final tropical watercolors, including Life-Size Black Bass. In this work, the artist placed the underside of the huge, brightly colored fish at center and close to the viewer, bringing alive the drama, immediacy, and excitement of the fisherman’s experience as his fly, a “scarlet ibis,” hangs in the air. With trademark ambiguity, Homer presented the bass suspended between life and death. Will it succeed in grabbing its bright target only to seal its fate? The fish’s sudden jump slices through the dark, quiet jungle with a momentary flash of life and color.In order to force the viewer into the path of the leaping fish, Homer cropped three centimeters off the lower edge of Life-Size Black Bass. He then centered and framed the fish for maximum effect by trimming a total of 2 centimeters from the right and left edges. The sheet dimensions are 350 x 526 millimeters; the original sheet dimensions were 380 x 545 millimeters as compared with uncut sheets of the same paper type. The trimmed edges appear slightly uneven and lack any adhesive residue from the watercolor paper block. As in a photograph with a short focal length, Homer presented the fish in tight focus against a vague and fluid background. With these compositional choices Homers heightened the tension of the strong, vital bass, frozen in motion, before capture and death. Such dramatic psychological impact results from Homer’s three decades of persistent observation using watercolor to transcribe nature on paper.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/189152/life-size-black-bass

Whistler dedicated much of his artistic practice to capturing the mood and color harmonies of marine scenes.

Many of his early sculptures employ secondhand dolls and stuffed animals. Used, soiled, and discarded, Kelley’s toys violate the sentimental association of youth with innocence. Eviscerated Corpse, from his series Half a Man, is one of the artist’s bestknown objects. Its cartoonish horror presents childhood as pathology: dolls and stuffed animals lack sexual specificity, which perhaps reflects the desire of adults to maintain the chastity of children. Kelley said that “the stuffed animal is a pseudo-child, a cutified sexless being which represents the adult’s perfect model of a child—a neutered pet.” His icon of childhood is a hypersexualized monster, with the tiny doll either spilling its intestines, giving birth, or both.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/146512/eviscerated-corpse

Completed in 1883, this impressive structure was still the longest suspension bridge in the world when Ranger painted it sixteen years later.

Previously acclaimed for lush, luminous abstract works, he turned to crude, awkward renderings of often-sinister figures and objects. “I got sick and tired of that purity,” he declared. “I wanted to tell stories.” In an outpouring of figurative work near the end of his career that employed recurring imagery such as cartoonish Ku Klux Klansmen and piles of prone legs with the soles of their shoes exposed, Guston addressed sociopolitical issues as well as his own artistic conflicts. Starkly titled, Bad Times is dominated by brushy, almost pearlescent passages of paint that seem at odds with, but that also ground, a graphic scene of violence or its aftermath.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/118569/bad-times

When he visited Key West, Florida, in the winter of 1903-04, he further indulged his interest in the details of local boating. There, Homer painted Stowing Sail on December 22, 1903. Everything about this watercolor points toward rapid, plein-air execution.The artist’s graphite underdrawing is a quick and sketchy series of lines that establish the major contours on the sheet. Pentiments, or shifts, in the underdrawing show that when he began the sketch, the figure was leaning further forward, gathering the sail over the back of the boat. This adjustment suggests that Homer was working quickly to keep up with the man’s progress.Homer applied all of his washes directly within the forms marked in the underdrawing, working wet-on-wet, as if there were not enough time to wait for one to dry before adding the next. When he brushed the heavy, red stroke at the front of the boat, it bled upward into the still-wet blue shadow on the side.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16831/stowing-sail

Later the canvas props that Oldenburg had sewn for earlier performancebased events led to large-scale soft sculptures.

In 1987 the artist made 24-x-20-inch Polaroid portraits of several fellow artists, which he then turned into studies for oil paintings. Two years later, he suffered a collapsed spinal artery, which severely limited his mobility and confined him to a wheelchair. With great determination, Close regained his former control of his medium, as this monumental portrait of the artist Alex Katz demonstrates. Like much of his recent work, it is less an exact likeness than an exploration of process.

In The Artist in His Studio, Whistler stares out at the viewer with palette and paintbrush in hand, surrounded by works from his collection: three Japanese scrolls hang on the wall and Chinese porcelain adorns shelves on the left. He applied thin layers of paint in muted tones to evoke the flattened appearance of Japanese woodblock prints. The composition also recalls the work of the Spanish Baroque master, Diego Velázquez.

The artist practiced architecture before becoming a painter, and late in life he returned to three-dimensional design, creating painted frames that complement his pictures.

usa_423,Karl Wirsum,Acrylic on canvas,Screamin’ Jay Hawkins,"After graduating from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in 1961, Karl Wirsum, a pioneer of the Hairy Who, a small group that exhibited together in the mid-to late 1960s, quickly went on to develop his signature style, which combines a graphic sensibility—vivid, flat colors; bold outlines; and simplified, cartoonlike figures—with a quirky sense of humor. Inspired largely by comic book figures and popular icons, Wirsum’s high-energy paintings typically feature a central, remarkably stylized figure. This painting portrays Screaming Jay Hawkins, one of the most eccentric performers in the history of rock and roll. Anticipating the later theatrics of Alice Cooper and David Bowie, Hawkins fashioned himself as the High Priest of Voodoo Rock with his elaborate costumes and macabre performances. The frenetic lines, electric colors, and exaggerated features in this painting demonstrate Wirsum’s long-held interest in activating the abstract underpinnings of his figurative work.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/109886/screamin-jay-hawkins

Although they often begin rationally, her performances progressively unravel, frequently devolving into discussion of eccentric topics or performances of taboo behaviors. Spanning more than a decade, the five works in the Art Institute’s collection are among Fraser’s earliest and most influential creations.Both Inaugural Speech and Official Welcome parody the rhetorical functions of institutional opening events. Inaugural Speech deals with the politics of international group exhibitions of contemporary art in an era of increasing globalization. Official Welcome questions the relationship between artists and patrons: at one point, Fraser completely disrobes to suggest the inherent exhibitionism involved in presenting art. The intelligence, clarity, and forcefulness of such performances have ensured the Fraser’s oeuvre remains a touchstone for critically engaged art of the 1990s and beyond.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/193360/official-welcome

In North Woods Club, Adirondacks (The Interrupted Tête-à-tête), hunting is only hinted at in a subliminal way. Homer pictured two white-tailed deer, a doe and a buck, at the edge of a mountain meadow. Homer selected the exact moment when the deer become aware of another presence, the identity of whom is left to the viewer’s imagination. He juxtaposed a yellow-green flowering meadow with cool, purple-blue mountains, creating an entrancing summer vista. Yet Homer alluded to a less-benign narrative that would have been clear to his contemporaries. Two tall white pines stand silhouetted against the view, echoing the two deer. White pine had been dangerously over harvested in this period, and worry over its dwindling numbers in the Adirondacks paralleled concern for excessive hunting of deer. Homer drew the pine trees and deer carefully in pencil before adding watercolor, making sure that the distinctive characteristics of both threatened species would be clearly identifiable.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/113100/north-woods-club-adirondacks-the-interrupted-tete-a-tete

Active in the artistic milieu of postwar New York, Siskind made photographs in dialogue with the work of the Abstract Expressionist painters, with whom he was socially and professionally close. He sought to find a new language for photographic depiction that could transcend what was in front of the camera. “First, and emphatically,” he wrote in 1950, “I accept the flat plane of the picture surface as the primary frame of reference of the picture.” Siskind’s radically abstract photographs of walls covered with graffiti, chalk, or peeling paint and paper would be recognized as a pioneering development in 20th-century photography.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/2976/new-york
usa_431,Ralph Albert Blakelock,Oil on canvas,Ghost Dance (The Vision of Life),"The Ghost Dance, or “Messiah Craze” as the press called it, fused elements of Native American religions and Christianity to express ideas about the resurrection and rejuvenation of indigenous cultures. An assertion of Native American pride and empowerment in the late 1880s, these ceremonies drew the attention of ethnographers and aroused the suspicions of United States government and military officials. After the murders of Big Foot and Sitting Bull and the massacre at Wounded Knee in 1890, the Ghost Dance became part of the mythology of the vanishing Indian. In Ralph Blakelock’s murky, deliberately ambiguous composition, the dancing figures appear as ghosts or shadows—insubstantial fragments of a memory or a dream. Indeed, the artist’s understanding of such performances was drawn from accounts in newspapers and magazines. He had not traveled to the West since the early 1870s, more than 20 years before painting this work.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/90062/ghost-dance-the-vision-of-life

Several utility poles frame the panorama, while the titular puff of smoke billows up from below eye level. Although Beal did not depict the source of the steam, it is probably from a passing train connecting Newburgh with the major metropolitan areas of New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut.

usa_437,Joseph Cornell,Box construction,Ann-In Memory,"The Theme of the hotel, treated here and in other boxes, had many ramifications for Cornell, intersecting with the bird boxes, the Navigation series, and the Juan Gris series, among others. Cornell‘s Hotel Boxes always contain references to travel in Europe, with echoes both of the seaside vacation and Grand Tour luxury of an earlier age. Postage stamps from far-flung places reinforce this impression in this box, as well as in the boxes known as Hôtel de La Duchesse-Anne and Hôtel du Nord . Ann—in Memory and Hôtel de la Duchesse-Anne share stamps from the same sets: the butterfly stamps are from a set issued by Mozambique in 1953, and the insect stamps in both boxes are from a set issued by Portuguese Guinea in 1953. This suggests that Cornell bought stamps in sets from a stamp-collector’s shop, rather than collecting them individually, at least during this period. The Saar stamps in Ann—in Memory are again part of one set, issued in 1952 by the National Relief Fund at a time when Saar, an embattled region on the border between France and Germany, was under French control; in 1957, it officially became part of West Germany. The stamp in the top right corner reproduces Johann Friedrich Dietrich’s Baron Emil von Maucler, and the one at lower right shows a detail from Murillo’s Two Boys Eating Melon and Grapes (Munich, Alte Pinakothek). It is difficult to say whether or not Cornell intended here a reference to the earlier, brief, failed political experiment in this region: the creation by the League of Nations of a small independent state after World War I, which was absorbed into Nazi Germany in 1935. Similarly it is difficult to judge whether the Haitian stamp at lower center, issued in 1954 to celebrate the 150th anniversary of Toussaint L’Ouverture’s revolution, has any particular significance. The Surrealists had a special link with Haiti: Breton stopped there for a while on his way back to France in December 1945, and was not only enchanted with the country but contributed through his lectures there to a political uprising. This stamp, then, does recall the journeyings of Cornell‘s more adventurous Surrealist colleagues. The butterfly and insect stamps in Hôtel de la Duchesse-Anne, however, have a specific iconographic function: they are clearly there to represent the food of the parrot shown seated on a branch, eyeing them. The image at upper right of Suzanne de Bourbon Praying by the Master of Moulins (Paris, Musée du Louvre) is related in subject to the two Saar stamps of children.An impression of neglect and decay, bordering on tawdriness, and a sensation of loneliness nag, however, at the glamorous associations of exotic postage stamps and foreign hotels—some even named after the stars of the great era of opera and ballet, such as the Hotel Taglioni in Florence (see Homage to the Romantic Ballet. There are elliptical hints of an empty bird box here, as in Hôtel du Nord, through the association of elements Cornell often placed in his bird boxes. These include the circular holes, like those of Dovecote, visible along the left interior wall, and the coiled metal springs. The interiors of these Hotel Boxes are more than usually worn. The white Paint in the interior of Hôtel de la Duchesse-Anne has been especially heavily applied and is severely cracked. In Ann—in Memory, there are patches of blue and yellow paint layered over the white, which, in conjunction with the fragments of printed paper advertising hotels and the scrap of aged newsprint visible through the flaking paint surface in the back left corner, bring to mind peeling walls and forgotten posters in the old quarters of a town. The same hotel advertisements and titles are used in several boxes; that in the center of Ann—in Memory for the Grand Hotel Fontaine in Ostend is a photostat of an advertisement, burnt round the edges, that Cornell used again in The Caliph of Baghdad of c. 1954 (Chicago, Bergman family; New York 1980-82, no. 135, ill.).A clue to the tangled sentiments in these boxes lies in the inscription, “Ann ~ in Memory” / Thomas De Quincey / Schumann “Etudes Symph.,” written on a label on the back of this box. The English author Thomas De Quincey (1785–1859) figures frequently in Cornell‘s writings; his story Ann of Oxford Street (partially reprinted in Ashton 1974, pp. 196–202) was especially resonant for the artist. It concerns the author’s lost, youthful love for a London girl of the streets. The story ends with a tumultuous dream (or to use the wonderful word Cornell coined to describe De Quincey’s English mail-coach, “tumultuousissamente”; Cornell 1993, p. 170). In this dream Ann reappears to the author, as she had been seventeen years before, “as for the last time I kissed her lips” (De Quincey, quoted in Ashton 1974, p. 198). Ann seems to have stood for Cornell as a symbol of tarnished purity; as he wrote in a diary entry of February 21, 1966: “I’d remembered the image of a diva of the bel canto era in a banal gilt plaster frame—recrimination for not having bought it for the more interesting visage—some deep poignancy in an adjacent area 8 Ave + 42 despoiled youth, innocence in a sadly bedraggled (De Quincey’s) Anne [sic] etc. etc.” (Cornell 1993, pp. 338–39). But it is also important not to isolate her from a whole nexus of associations and memories, exemplified by the shift in De Quincey’s dream from the vision of Ann to a dream of a “far different character—a tumultuous dream—commencing with a music.” As De Quincey described it, “the undulations of fast-gathering tumults were like the opening of the Coronation Anthem; and, like that, gave the feeling of a multitudinous movement, of infinite cavalcades filing off, and the tread of innumerable armies. The morning was come of a mighty day—a day of crises and of ultimate hope for human nature” (De Quincey, quoted in Ashton 1974, p. 200). This apocalyptic scene would seem far from the nostalgia and mild decay of Ann—in Memory, but it points to Cornell’s belief in the potential of the least fragment or scrap of music to unleash powerful memories and emotions.— Entry, Dawn Ades, Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1997, p. 72-73.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/99790/ann-in-memory

usa_441,Andy Warhol,Color screenprint on cream card,Marilyn Monroe (Marilyn),"Due in part to his experience as a highly successful commercial illustrator in the 1950s, Andy Warhol was as much businessman as artist and understood the value of mass production and distribution. By the early 1960s, screenprinting had become the favored medium for commercial printing jobs, such as labels and signage. It was used to quickly reproduce photographic images on almost any flat surface. By 1962 Warhol had begun using it to put repeated images on his canvases—images that he had previously painted painstakingly by hand. Because Warhol had not finessed the process, his printing “mistakes” became a signature. In 1967 he began publishing limited-edition print portfolios in his studio under the aegis of Factory Editions.Marilyn was the first such portfolio, consisting of ten images made from the same 1953 publicity photograph of Marilyn Monroe in the film Niagara, which Warhol transformed with intentionally off-register printing and garish combinations of psychedelic colors. Daylight fluorescent colors, better known as Day-Glo colors, were invented in the 1930s, and by the 1960s had become integral to the graphic vocabulary of Pop art. While a conventional bright color reflects 80 to 90 percent of its color, a Day-Glo color appears to reflect more than 300 percent of its color. It is no wonder then that art historian Robert Rosenblum observed that Marilyn’s face “seems perpetually illuminated by the afterimage of a flashbulb.” With this method and presentation, Warhol and his work became synonymous with Pop Art.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/150052/marilyn-monroe-marilyn

In such early paintings as It’s A New Age, characteristic scrawls, doodles, erasures, graphic representations of the body, and text convey the artist’s own scathingly critical thoughts. Her voice, which takes the form of transcribed, seemingly unedited notes, addresses her identity as both a woman and a painter. Willams uses verbal puns and scatological imagery to comment on the degradation of the female body—through sexual violence and abuse—and the psychological trauma of self-loathing. The artist parodies the politics of “choice”—she declares in the painting that she is “free to choose” and “I chose fat thighs”—by articulating personal struggle.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/185561/it-s-a-new-age

usa_450,Bill Viola,"Color video, sound (monitor), wood chair, headphones, spotlight, and pedestal",Reasons for Knocking at an Empty House,"For over thirty years, Bill Viola has created single-channel videos as well as sound and video installations that focus on spirituality and explore multiple levels of human consciousness. In constructing these works, the artist draws from his extensive study of Eastern and Western art, philosophy, and religion. He also consistently deploys cutting-edge technologies, investigating new ways to manipulate viewers’ perception. Both the videos in The Reflecting Pool and the installation Reasons for Knocking at an Empty House are important early works that foreshadow Viola’s later creations, combining philosophic inquiry with captivating physical environments.The haunting Reasons for Knocking at an Empty House contains a solitary wood chair with headphones attached, facing a television monitor. Viola, looking visibly fatigued, appears on the screen, sitting in his own chair. Here, the artist compels viewers into an intimate relationship: they sit at eye level with him, listening to the sound of his breathing through the headphones. The silence and tension in the installation is disrupted at irregular intervals by a dissonant, jarring sound that echoes throughout the gallery. At the same time, Viola is hit over the head with a magazine. Taken as a whole, the work suggests a scene of execution or torture, with its single chair and its haggard artist, sleep-deprived and assaulted while seated alone in an empty room.In both The Reflecting Pool and Reasons for Knocking at an Empty House, the artist urges viewers to become active participants. Of his work, Viola stated, “You’re a part of it. It’s not something that’s just a fixed projection from the past.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/122701/reasons-for-knocking-at-an-empty-house

usa_456,Joseph Cornell,Box construction,For Juan Gris #7,"Cornell’s interest in the cubist artist Juan Gris prompted a series of boxes and several collages, as well as a dossier containing notes, cutout reproductions, and catalogues. At least fifteen boxes and several collages related to Gris have been identified by Lynda Roscoe Hartigan (see Anne d’Harnoncourt, “The Cubist Cockatoo: A Preliminary Exploration of Joseph Cornell‘s Homages to Juan Gris,” Philadelphia Museum of Art Bulletin 74 [June 1978, p. 6). The imagery of this series of boxes is tied both to Cornell’s bird boxes and to his Hotel Boxes. In boxes such as this one, Cornell showed an unusual and subtle response to Gris’s unique type of Cubist collage. This is particularly apparent when, as in this case, the white cockatoo that is so often the central feature in the Gris series is absent and only the outline remains, echoed by a black paper shadow more geometric in character than the outline itself. The play between representation and reality so central to Cubism is alluded to not just in the outline and shadow, and in the central cluster of forms of varying degree of abstraction, but also in the real wooden branch extending from the rear wall of the box-cage.Here Cornell used a French newspaper text to cover the inside walls of the box, integrating it into the box’s surface by painting and pasting over it in a manner similar to Gris‘s. More generally, however, Gris’s persistent love of the particular shapes of his objects and his unexpected tenderness for the picturesque and romantic (see, for example, his 1914 Flowers, collection Hester Diamond, or his 1913 Guitar, Paris, Musée national d’art moderne, with its fragment of a sentimental nineteenth century print; ill. in London, Whitechapel Art Gallery, Juan Gris, 1992, exh. cat., nos. 44, 28, respectively) find an echo in Cornell. As Anne d’Harnoncourt noted, “The bits of newsprint, flowered and marbleized papers, or empty tobacco packets in Gris’s collages of 1913–14 have a keepsake quality quite unlike similar fragments incorporated into works by Picasso and Braque” (d’Harnoncourt 1978, p. 9). Moreover, Gris incorporated a fragment of mirror into his Washstand of 1912 (private collection; Douglas Cooper, Juan Gris, vol. 1, Paris, 1977, no. 26, ill.).This is not to argue an “influence” of a simple or direct kind. Cornell’s work is built on a series of responses and experiences of a peculiarly private nature. There is no obvious reason, for example, for Cornell‘s choice of a cockatoo as the emblem of his Gris Boxes. Music, so important to Cornell, may have provided the thread of connections here. It seems that he associated Gris with the nineteenth-century contralto Malibran, who like Gris died at a tragically young age, and was described as “the bird of song” by Hans Christian Andersen, whom Cornell also admired (Ashton 1974, p. 24, citing Monica Stirling, The Life and Times of Hans Christian Andersen, New York, 1965).Although Cornell could well have been familiar with Gris’s work earlier (Curt Valentin’s Buchholz Gallery, New York, held an exhibition in 1950), it was the sight of Figure Seated in a Cafe (1914, Mr. and Mrs. Leigh B. Block; Cooper 1977,) in 1953 at the Sidney Janis Gallery, New York, that first seized his imagination. He wrote in retrospect, in 1961: “The so-called ‘Juan Gris’ boxes were not worked out slavishly —mechanically—from this collected material the original inspiration was purely a human reaction to a particular painting at the Janis Gallery—a man reading a newspaper at a cafe table covered almost completely by his reading material” (Cornell 1993, p. 285). Cornell’s interest in Gris, which lasted through the mid-1960s, experienced a renewal in the late 1950s with the large Gris retrospective at The Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1958, and the publication of John Golding’s Cubism: A History and an Analysis in 1959, to which he referred on several occasions in his diaries. Cornell‘s practice of working on a piece over a period of several years, or of leaving it fallow for a while, seems to be true of For Juan Gris #7. He wrote in a diary entry of January 1960 (Cornell 1993, p. 273): “1/24/60 Sunday Gris #7 / ‘creative’ reviewing / Gris #7 taken from storage in semi-unresolved difficult time—and then—miracle of unfoldment / appreciation / ‘treasure’” Whether Cornell implied here, through the use of one of his favorite words, “unfoldment,” that he resolved the work, or simply reviewed it and found it complete, remains uncertain.— Entry, Dawn Ades, Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1997, p. 76-77.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/99771/for-juan-gris-7

Over the course of ten days, clothes by Balenciaga, Dior, Rochas, and others were rushed to an old top-floor studio, where Penn posed models against a discarded theater curtain. The resulting photographs, spread across two September issues, marked a stark departure from the elaborately staged sets favored by fashion photographers of the previous decade. Among the models, Lisa Fonssagrives was a standout—in 1949, at age 38, she had become the first model to grace the cover of Time magazine, earning the title “Billion-Dollar Baby.” The statuesque icon first captured Penn’s attention at a 1947 photo shoot, and in the years that followed she became his muse and collaborator.

Here, the gnarled trunk and branches of the weather-beaten tree offered the artist interesting variations of color, tone, and line. Cropsey often included such old trees in his paintings in emulation of Thomas Cole, whom he greatly admired.

This painting features a young woman looking at burgeoning peach blossoms, indicating both early spring and perhaps her youth. The setting, which often recurs in Homer’s oeuvre, reflects nostalgia for a fading rural past. Contemporary critics referred to the artist’s style at this time as independent of foreign influences, suggesting an inherently American quality. However, his stylistic decisions link this work to both French and Japanese art. Impressionism inspired Homer’s use of a lighter palette, and the attention to linearity in the tree is reminiscent of Japanese calligraphy. The painting thus serves as visual evidence of the global artistic exchange of the late 19th century.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/55494/peach-blossoms

usa_464,David Hammons,"Single-channel video, color, sound; 5 min. 20 sec.; unnumbered from an edition of twenty-five, plus 3 artist’s proofs",Phat Free,"Working with the detritus of African American life, David Hammons addresses black history, African culture, racism, and poverty with a compassion and complexity unrivaled in contemporary practice. With cunning wordplay and biting sarcasm, he transforms found objects often culled from the streets of New York—these include basketball hoops, chicken wings, dirt, and dreadlock clippings—into powerful symbols that challenge stereotypes and confront issues of race. Street culture provides the artist not only with source material but also with a primary audience: Hammons often creates installations and stages performances on corners and vacant lots, notoriously shunning most of the art world’s galleries and museums. The artist has said, “I think I spend 85 percent of my time on the streets as opposed to in the studio. So when I go to the studio, I expect to regurgitate these experiences of the street. All of the things that I see socially—the social conditions of racism—come out like a sweat.”Phat Free begins with several minutes of darkness overlaid with an unidentifiable loud, metallic sound. As the video image is revealed, a man—Hammons himself—appears dressed in a long coat, felt hat, and sneakers, kicking a metal bucket down a deserted city sidewalk late at night. The work was shot in 1995 to document Hammons’s late-night performance and edited into an independent video work four years later. At first seemingly violent, the noise evolves into an almost musical rhythm that is synchronized with the protagonist’s methodical movements. The title elaborates this musical allusion, conjuring both the streetwise lyricism of rap and hip-hop and the improvisational nature of jazz.The video’s rough, grainy texture communicates the harsh reality of life on the streets and also evokes the early performance videos of Vito Acconci, Bruce Nauman, and others. In and of itself, the action of kicking the bucket suggests the man’s potentially unfortunate fate. At once jarring and poetic, Hammons’s simple gesture becomes an act of symphonic proportion, a compelling metaphor for one kind of contemporary black urban experience.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/185068/phat-free
usa_465,Wayne Thiebaud,Oil on canvas,Row of Ties,"Wayne Thiebaud’s still-life paintings of food and consumer goods established him as an early pioneer of Pop Art. Along with cakes, lipsticks, and toys, ties were among his most popular motifs. His interest in a formal approach to composition led him to explore many variations of this subject, depicting ties on racks or in piles and stacks. In Row of Ties, unexpected color harmonies and inventive paint handling emphasize the flatness and tactility of the hanging ties, creating a rhythmic composition that appears simultaneously real and abstract. Thiebaud’s isolation of these objects against a white background evokes his experience in advertising and his understanding of the visual impact of commercial artists’ treatment of their subjects. While it was common to devalue such work on the basis of its easy commercial appeal, Thiebaud explained, “I had too much respect for commercial artists.

Hassam depicted sand dunes rising from behind the beach with the promenade and its costumed bathers at a distance, reinforcing the fact that he, and the viewer, are excluded from this privileged setting.

These discarded commonplace objects allude to older ways of life and fading memories. Peto specialized in trompe l’oeil (fools the eye) pictures; yet his soft-edged style is suggestive of the artist’s hand rather than the heightened illusionism employed by other trompe l’oeil painters such as William Harnett.

This performance was created with an experimental theater company for the Philadelphia Museum of Art’s Duchamp Centennial in 1987.

usa_470,David Wojnarowicz,"Spray enamel, ink, and paper collage on board",Untitled,"David Wojnarowicz was identified by The New York Times critic, Michael Kimmelman, in 1992 as “one of the most influential artists of the 1980s.” Wojnarowicz first emerged in the context of the brash and brief burst of energy that took place in New York’s East Village in the beginning of the 1980s. Fusing the aesthetics of the punk-music scene, a keen awareness of an ethnically diverse street culture, and a committed sense of political activism, Wojnarowicz’s earliest works were often informal and ephemeral. The 1980s East Village scene in which Wojnarowicz thrived produced a number of artists who went on to broader recognition, including Keith Haring, Kenny Scharf, Jenny Holzer, and Jean-Michel Basquiat. His paintings, photographs, installations, performances, and experimental films are distinguished by raw expressions of rage and personal longing. Wojnarowicz’s work, most often concerned with the inequities and disenfranchisement of living with HIV and AIDS, ranged from the intentionally shrill to the elegiac. A gifted writer, the poignant beauty of his vision is perhaps best glimpsed through his published journal excerpts, short stories, and autobiographical essays. Indeed, the artist is now widely recognized for the strength of his artistic expression both in the visual arts and with the written word.

DeCarava later reflected: “Their figures remind me so much of the real-life experiences of blacks in their need to put themselves in an awkward position before the man, for the man; to demean themselves in order to survive.

usa_479,Joseph Cornell,Box construction,Untitled (Forgotten Game),"The Forgotten games are among the most evocative of Cornell’s boxes, and the Bergman version is perhaps the most completely realized of them all. There are evidently links here with the Dovecote series, but the primary reference is to games and toys, which had an enduring fascination for Cornell. As is often the case with Cornell‘s work, the active involvement of the spectator is invited. This box is not a purely visual game; it also moves and makes sounds. As noted in the media description, through a small trapdoor in the upper right side of the box, a ball can be rolled down a series of ramps to hit five yellow bells hung above the ramps, which the ball rings as it passes, finally hitting the silver bell visible through the cracked pane of glass at the bottom right. This last bell rings with a faint, flawed note as though penetrating a fog at sea. Five rows of six circular holes each are cut into the wood front of the box, which is painted an ivory white and weathered to look like a neglected birdhouse. Cornell devised various ways of purposefully aging surfaces, and the flaking of the paint here, like the cracked glass, is intentional. The holes are smallest at the beginning of each slope and increase in size, as it were, in pace with the growing noise of the ball gathering speed as it descends each ramp in turn.Sounds are essential to this box: both the rumbling of the rolling ball and the periodic tinkling of the bells. ‘Writing about this work, Diane Waldman recalled Max Ernst quoting Leonardo da Vinci, “like the tinkling of a bell, which makes one hear that which one imagines” (Max Ernst, “Au dela de la peinture,” Cahiers d’art 2, 6 – 7 [1936], n. pag.; cited in Waldman 1977, p. 26). One is also reminded of the continuous ringing of a bell in Salvador Dalí and Luis Bunuel’s film L’Age d’or (1929), throughout the scene in which the young woman gazes into a mirror and dreams of the man she loves. In this box, Cornell used sound as vividly as he did visual and kinetic elements to invoke memory.— Entry, Dawn Ades, Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1997, p.58-59.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/99773/untitled-forgotten-game

This sculpture is indeed powerful, but its emotional intensity is not achieved through brute force of carving or any “primitivizing” influence. Rather, it succeeds through its brilliant balance of exaggeration and restraint. Its sheer physical presence is conveyed through the impressive bulk of the marble block—often scavenged from abandoned buildings.

Toy is atypical in its incorporation of a Slip n’ Slide (a plastic waterslide first introduced in 1961); the work slyly suggests a classical relief and the motif of drapery.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/32587/toy

Produced at the height of his career, this view of the sea at Nahant, Massachusetts, recalls 17th-century Dutch landscapes in the way that it captures changing atmospheric conditions and their effect on the surroundings without any hint of a narrative. Such paintings made Doughty one of the most popular landscapists in the United States in the 1820s and 1830s. In elevating nature as a worthy subject in its own right, Doughty, like fellow artist Thomas Cole, was particularly influential for the generation of landscape painters who came after him, namely the Hudson River School.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/185185/coming-squall-nahant-beach-with-a-summer-shower

usa_506,Andy Warhol,Color screenprint on cream card,Marilyn Monroe (Marilyn),"Due in part to his experience as a highly successful commercial illustrator in the 1950s, Andy Warhol was as much businessman as artist and understood the value of mass production and distribution. By the early 1960s, screenprinting had become the favored medium for commercial printing jobs, such as labels and signage. It was used to quickly reproduce photographic images on almost any flat surface. By 1962 Warhol had begun using it to put repeated images on his canvases—images that he had previously painted painstakingly by hand. Because Warhol had not finessed the process, his printing “mistakes” became a signature. In 1967 he began publishing limited-edition print portfolios in his studio under the aegis of Factory Editions.Marilyn was the first such portfolio, consisting of ten images made from the same 1953 publicity photograph of Marilyn Monroe in the film Niagara, which Warhol transformed with intentionally off-register printing and garish combinations of psychedelic colors. Daylight fluorescent colors, better known as Day-Glo colors, were invented in the 1930s, and by the 1960s had become integral to the graphic vocabulary of Pop art. While a conventional bright color reflects 80 to 90 percent of its color, a Day-Glo color appears to reflect more than 300 percent of its color. It is no wonder then that art historian Robert Rosenblum observed that Marilyn’s face “seems perpetually illuminated by the afterimage of a flashbulb.” With this method and presentation, Warhol and his work became synonymous with Pop Art.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/150046/marilyn-monroe-marilyn

usa_508,Sam Gilliam,Acrylic and canvas draped over wooden sawhorses,“A” and the Carpenter I,"With an artistic career spanning more than six decades, abstract painter Sam Gilliam continually pushed the boundaries of color and form. Associated with the Washington Color School movement, it was in the early 1960s when Gilliam began staining unprimed and unstretched canvases with diluted acrylic paint rather than using traditional brushstroke techniques. By the end of the 1960s, he started experimenting with crumpling, folding, and draping these canvases before arranging them in site-specific spaces or wrapping them around variably shaped framed stretchers to dispense a more sculptural approach. The malleability of these canvases echoes the fluidity of the paint and vice versa. A quintessential work, “A” and the Carpenter I is a painting on a grand scale, and yet, like a stained drop cloth slung across two sawhorses, it evokes a snapshot of the artist’s studio.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/45860/a-and-the-carpenter-i
usa_509,Richard Nickel,Gelatin silver print,"Untitled (The Rookery, staircase)","While studying photography at the Institute of Design in Chicago, Richard Nickel joined the Sullivan Project, a photographic survey, led by photographer Aaron Siskind, that documented the architecture of Louis Sullivan. The project was completed in 1954, but Nickel continued photographing Sullivan’s work on his own, finding his calling in the identification, documentation, and preservation of these endangered works of art. Sullivan was revered as the father of the skyscraper and renowned for his use of architectural ornament. His firm, Adler and Sullivan, was based in Chicago, and the city was home to many examples of his work. But by the 1950s urban renewal projects prompted the demolition of his most celebrated structures, including the Garrick Theater and the Stock Exchange Building.For nearly two decades, Nickel campaigned to save Sullivan’s works, and when those efforts failed, he worked to rescue their ornament—the elaborate, nature-inspired decoration that adorned both the interiors and exteriors of Sullivan’s buildings. Nickel mourned the disappearance of a city he admired, warning that Chicago could move toward anonymity or, worse, become “a city of contrasts: The superficial glitter of the new mixed with the slum of the old.” Nickel’s photographs let the architecture take center stage, even if his documentation was later overshadowed by his efforts to rescue surviving structures and fragments. In 1972, one such attempt, in the Chicago Stock Exchange Building, cost him his life. The Sun-Times wrote: “Richard Nickel has become a true martyr to the cause of architectural preservation. He is irreplaceable, and Chicago architecture has lost its truest champion.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/141975/untitled-the-rookery-staircase
usa_510,Arthur B. Carles,Oil on canvas,Calla Lilies,"In 1922, Arthur B. Carles began a series of calla lily paintings, using the flowers’ stark shapes as the basis for formal experiments into color and surface. Calla lilies were of particular interest to Carles’s fellow modernists such as Georgia O’Keeffe, Charles Demuth, and Marsden Hartley because of their sexual connotations, which these artists frequently exaggerated or exploited. Carles’s Calla Lilies does not appear to carry any erotic overtones but instead is restrained in color and almost classically composed. Carles played with the effects of light and shadow on the curving shapes of the blossoms, contrasting the firmly modeled white flowers with the more loosely painted background. These juxtapositions expressed his fascination with the play of space in his compositions, and he likened the deliberate intervals between the flowers to the rhythmic qualities of music.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/193869/calla-lilies

Its spare elegance, the contrast of the simple “rustic” frame with the picturesque intricacy of the wooded landscape, and the various light effect s created by the blue glass and the mirror seem to recreate the experience of open-air ballet. The swan itself fills the foreground and appears at home in its natural setting, but is simultaneously distanced from it by the blue moonlight, its identity with the ballerina indicated only by a brilliant, clear gemstone (a second one is now lost). Cornell has here restricted his incorporation of the delicate and decorative materials associated with the ballerina‘s presence, which elsewhere include feathers and sequins, to this artificial diamond, a conceit in keeping with the paradoxical nature of the event.— Entry, Dawn Ades, Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1997, p.57.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/99786/cygne-crepusculaire-twilight-swan
usa_513,Joseph Cornell,Box construction,Dovecote (Colombier),"This work belongs to a series of boxes, often referred to as Dovecotes, whose spare, geometric structure brings them very close to abstraction. In one of the earliest of these, Untitled (Multiple Cubes) of 1946–48 (New York 1980–82, no. 173, ill.), vertical and horizontal slats create a regular, three-dimension al grid, which houses slightly irregular cubes. In several of these Dovecote Boxes, the compartments are rectangular and in some cases contain balls; here, the openings are circular, as in an actual dovecote, or colombier. This kind of birdhouse, often of grand proportions, was used to breed pigeons and had access holes small enough to prevent the entry of predators.Although Cornell frequently used repetition as a formal device, the Dovecote Boxes are unusual in that the repetitions, with sometimes minute variations, constitute both form and image. The boxes with a rectangular grid most closely recall the New York paintings of Piet Mondrian, such as New York City of 1941–42 (Paris, Musée national d’art moderne; see The Hague, Haags Gemeentemuseum, Piet Mondrian, 1872–1944, 1994, exh. cat., no. 164, ilL), with its sense of architectural scale. This Dovecote also recalls the pure forms and white interiors of the International Style. That Cornell was indeed thinking in terms of architecture is confirmed by a diary note of January 2–3, 1950. In it he recorded a particularly fruitful day in New York when he found “Thibault [sic] Perspectives” and a French architectural magazine in the Corner Bookshop: “the whiteness and imagery of the Thibault [sic] supplemented thoughts about working on the bird boxes with their architecture” (Cornell 1993, p. 167). Cornell was presumably referring here to a treatise on perspective by Jean Thomas Thibaut (1757–1826), which was published posthumously in Paris in 1827 as Application de la perspective lineaire aux arts du dessin (the author’s last name is spelled Thibault in this 1827 publication). It was one of a large number of such studies intended for instruction in academies and schools in nineteenth century France.Cornell‘s interest in a grid structure that produces a kind of taxonomic arrangement, but with abstract connotations, finds some parallels, moreover, in the work of other American artists, such as Adolph Gottlieb (sec, for example, Gattlieb’s Man Looking at Woman of 1949, in Rubin 1968. fig. D-262). It also echoes works by Max Ernst that use a compartmentalized structure to contain individual images, such as Vox Angelica of 1943 (Ernst Katalog, vol. 5, 1987, p. 76, no. 2448, ill.).Despite their formal purity, the Dovecote Boxes are rich in associations. For instance, the round holes in Dovecote recall the portholes of the great ocean liners linking New York to Europe, a part of the world with which Cornell had strong spiritual ties, exemplified by his debt to French Romantic and Symbolist poets and to the Surrealists. A work entitled Porthole Cage was indeed included in Cornell’s “Aviary” exhibition of the previous veal at the Egan Gallery, New York (Dec. 1949).As noted in the above media description, there is a small strip of wood resembling a perch below each of the holes in the top foul rows. While this feature tends to reinforce the notion of a birdhouse, the box’s structure also strongly resembles two types of games. First, it has affinities with the generic type to which Forgotten Game also belongs, in which a ball or balls are rolled along channels, or may drop into or out of slots. Secondly, it recalls the ancient Chinese strategy game Go (and the modern Othello), in which black and white pebbles or counters are moved on a board. But in the case of this box, the pattern or necessary order is not given, and one returns to a contemplation of the more abstract relationship between the contrasting white and “black” holes, as in a Constellation by Jean Arp. In spite of the apparently rigid arrangement, there is a strong sense of randomness or, to follow the analogy with Arp, of a type of order so in accessible to the viewer that it is perceived as chance.The interplay between the minimal and the associative recalls works by Marcel Duchamp, such as Why Not Sneeze, Rose Sélavy? (1921, Philadelphia Museum of Art; see Pontus Hulten, ed., Marcel Duchamp: Work and Life, Cambridge, Mass., 1993, p. 79, ill.); in the latter, a bird cage is filled with marble cubes resembling sugar lumps in a type of visual pun of which there are certainly echoes here. In a closely related Dovecote by Cornell of 1952 (New York, private collection; sec Waldman 1977, pl. 85), a narrow horizontal space at the base of the box contains three wooden balls that appear to have dropped from the holes above. They inevitably recall eggs at the base of nesting boxes, and remind us that at this time Cornell was fascinated by what he referred to as “Magritte-like puns” (diary entry of May 1950; Cornell 1993, p. 171). He might have had in mind such paintings as Rene Magritte’s Elective Affinities (1933, Paris, private collection; David Sylvester, Magritte: The Silence of the World, New York, 1992, p. 221, ill.), which shows not a bird, but a large egg in side a bird cage. Magritte described this as a “new and astonishing poetic secret, for the shock I experienced was provoked precisely by the affinity between two objects, the cage and the egg, whereas previously I had provoked such shocks by juxtaposing objects without the remotest kinship” (quoted in Sylvester 1992, p. 223). Magritte’s exploration of affinities rather than differences between objects to evoke a sense of the marvelous has parallels with Cornell’s practice.— Entry, Dawn Ades, Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1997, p.62-63.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/99768/dovecote-colombier

Stieglitz took this photograph from the back of a moving train as it pulled out of the train yard in Long Island City, New York, and the image was published in the first issue of Camera Work in January 1903.

usa_527,Joseph Cornell,box construction,Untitled (Large Owl),"Cornell’s owls, illustrated here by this box and a slightly later one, titled Untitled (Lighted Owl), form a distinct group among his bird boxes. The catalogue of William Copley’s 1948 exhibition, Objects by Joseph Cornell, which included a box entitled Owl (Habitat Setting), contained evocative descriptions of the various categories of objects, including “Owl—a habitat with secrets.” In creating settings that are dark, mysterious, and woody, Cornell appears to have sought a more complete illusion of the owl‘s natural habitat than he did normally for his birds.The making of the Owl Boxes dates largely from the mid-1940s, a time when Cornell took many rural excursions by bicycle from his home on Utopia Parkway in Flushing, New York. In his diary, he wrote eloquently about the nostalgia and elation aroused by the sight of the old houses and meadows in the outlying suburbs, andhe recorded memorably how he gathered the materials for the Owl Boxes:“the many trips made by bicycle gathering dried grasses of different kinds, the fantastic aspect of arriving home almost hidden on the vehicle by the loads piled highthe transcendent experiences of threshing in the cellar, stripping the stalks on to newspaper’s, the sifting of the dried seeds, then the pulverizing by hand and storing in boxes.These final siftings were used for habitat (imaginative) boxes of birds, principally owls. The boxes were given a coating of glue on the insides then the grass dust thrown in and shaken around until all the sides had an even coating to give them the aspect of a tree-trunk or nest interior.” (Cornell 1993, p, 117).In a diary entry of April 15, 1946, he wrote about “the ‘discovery’ for the owI boxes in progress” of what he described as a “particularly fine example of rotted tree from which a piece of bark and clinging trailing shrubbery branches had fallen,” Cornell continued his account by noting that he “took off by the handful the wood from outer part of trunk which was in powder state lined box that evening and added powdered wood to Natural History boxes” (Cornell 1993, p. 128), On another occasion, in late August 1946, Cornell rode out in the late afternoon and, as he recorded in his diary, in a “cleared field by pile of stumps (dumping ground) found many fine pieces of fungi—3 or 4 coral pieces, bark. Turned off toward Bayside-was strongly reminded in the autumnal evening of former vacations in country” (Cornell 1993, p. 132). The fungi mentioned here may have included the ones incorporated into this box. These finds of country flotsam were powerfully evocative of Cornell’s childhood, of a lost American countryside, and an even more distant, imagined past. Pounding his grasses, he thought of himself working like an herbalist or apothecary of old with these sweet scents in my own fashion “ (Cornell 1993, p. 117).Surrounded by these natural materials, Cornell felt his boxes were “ like a bird’s own nest,” and this realization, he wrote, “ was inexpressibly satisfying in such a warm and redolent atmosphere” (Cornell 1993, p. 117). This description suggests the artist’s high degree of identification with the bird in its womblike home; there is indeed a strong sense, in these diary jottings, of Cornell living and reliving various real and imagined experiences in the preparation and making of the boxes.But Cornell was also capable of playing on the humorous aspects of his vaguely anthropomorphic fee lings about the “habitats,” as suggested by a diary note of July 10, 1948, which included an advertisement for a comfortable holiday home for owls, with picturesque associations: “Large SEQUESTERED BOWER – HUMOROUS COMPARTMENTS—LOOK-OUTS; GUEST ROOMS; LOUNGE; IVY COVERED OBSERVATORY FOR EARLY DAWN VIEWS…. moss lined alcoves with dripping water and large variety snails” (Cornell Papers, AA A, reel lOS8; cited in Dawn Ades, “The Transcendental-Surrealism of Joseph Cornell,” in New York 1980–82, p. 41).The owls themselves in the two Bergman examples are ingeniously constructed of ready-made, paper illustrations, which are pasted onto half-inch thick, flat pieces of wood, cut out to form the silhouette of an owl. In the case of Large Owl, as mentioned in the media description, two yellow plastic eyes with brown centers are glued to the image. In the later Lighted Owl, a large plastic spider rests on the tip of the piece of bark on which the owl is perched. Such devices clearly point up the ambiguity of what Cornell called his “Natural History” habitats, where the clash between the natural elements, such as bark and moss, and the modern, manufactured materials posits their artificiality and makes very explicit the distance between Cornell‘s boxes and the dioramas of a natural history museum with their “real” stuffed birds, of which he undoubtedly knew (see Ades, in New York 1980–82, p. 38).Since antiquity, owls have been associated not only with wisdom, but also with death. The owl is Minerva’s bird, and also that of the alchemists, not too distant cousins of the apothecaries with whom Cornell identified as he prepared his grasses. The owl’s association with death often takes the form of a warning about mortality: the “remember thine end” of the memento mori. One such image, with which Cornell was certainly familiar, a Memento Mori of 1769, exhibited in Fantastic Art, Dada, Surrealism at The Museum of Modern Art, New York, in 1936-37 (see exh. cat., no. 90, ill.), shows an owl perched on a head that is half skull, half living face, with the trappings of the vanitas theme around it.— Entry, Dawn Ades, Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1997, p.53-54.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/99760/untitled-large-owl

According to the Chicago collector Arthur Jerome Eddy (portrait nearby), the artist painted this seascape while boating off the coast as a crewman steadied their vessel. This could account for the unusually broad handling of paint and thick touches of pigment apparent throughout the composition, particularly in the clouds and gently cresting waves.

Despite Homer’s indication of impending bad weather moving in from the horizon, this watercolor focuses on a moment of calm before the storm. The water’s turquoise surface is smooth and tranquil, achieved by pure, transparent washes. The artist’s loose, abstract handling of the rugged shore in the foreground calls attention to the sheer beauty of his brushstrokes.Homer conjured the effect of land, sea, and sky seen through a veil of rain and humidity by painting wet-on-wet. In this manner, the artist introduced a new wash into one that is still wet, allowing colors to run and blend without solid boundaries.

While the figures laugh, drink martinis, and smoke cigars, the winter landscape outside stands in acute contrast to the interior comforts of warm conversation and lightweight clothing.

Two decades later Lichtenstein used his signature mode to mimic the style and subjects of another artist entirely: Abstract Expressionist painter Willem de Kooning. In Woman III Lichtenstein injected both humor and a Pop Art chill into the older painter’s wriggling swaths and slashes of bold color while playing directly on de Kooning’s series of confrontational “Woman” paintings.

Thompson spent three years (1908–11) studying in Paris, where she began painting in a Fauvist idiom and met her future husband, artist William Zorach. Although the location in this painting is unknown, Thompson might have made the brilliantly hued canvas while traveling back to the United States from Paris; her adventurous seven-month trip took her through Egypt, Palestine, India, Burma, Malaysia, Indonesia, China, Korea, and Japan. The wedges of color in the painting suggest the contours of a hill, yet their interlocking forms illustrate Thompson’s desire to create compositions that were “perfectly flat, no planes, distance, perspective, or anything.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/201806/landscape-recto
usa_545,Joseph Cornell,Collage composed of cut and pasted commercially printed papers with sprayed and spattered gouache on blue wove paper,Homage to Tamara Toumanova,"Cornell’s passion for the ballet, illustrated here by this collage and several other works (Untitled (For Tamara Toumanova), Homage to the Romantic Ballet, Cygne Crépusculaire (Twilight Swan), and Untitled (Lighted Dancer)), centered on nineteenth-century Romantic ballet and its contemporary manifestations. Most of his many boxes, collages, and keepsakes connected with ballet are firmly rooted in the traditional imagery of the Romantic ballet, particularly that of its most famous examples: Swan Lake (1877) and Ondine (1869). Cornell’s works would lead us to conclude that he showed little interest in other forms of dance, including the Surrealist ballets Baccanale (1939) and Labyrinth (1941), grand productions of which were mounted at New York’s Metropolitan Opera House with sets and costumes designed by Salvador Dalí (Dalí’s own paranoiac ballet Mad Tristan, with music by Richard Wagner, premiered in 1944). Cornell’s contributions to the journal Dance Index, however, demonstrate that his sensibility did respond to other types of dance, revealing the extraordinary depth of his knowledge of and interest in every aspect of the history of this most ephemeral of art forms.Ballet had become the rage in the United States during the 1930s, and Lincoln Kirstein, one of the founders of Dance Index in 1942, was one of the first to set up an American-based dance company in 1934, called American Ballet. Cornell not only designed many of the covers of Dance Index, including that of the first issue, a montage of an unusually modernist character entitled Homage to Isadora, he also contributed material from his extensive archives and collections of memorabilia. The great stars of nineteenth-century Romantic ballet—Fanny Cerrito, Fanny Elssler, Carlotta Grisi, and Marie Taglioni—all figure prominently in his work (see, for instance, the cover to “Le Quator danse a Londre,” Dance lndex 3,7–8 [July–Aug. 1944]). Cornell’s interest in these famous ballerinas was profound and in a sense scholarly, but his contributions to the magazine are often even more remarkable for their wide-ranging imaginative connections and revealing biographical anecdote. One interesting issue, compiled and arranged entirely by Cornell, was “Americana Romantic Ballet” (Dance Index 6, 9 [Sept. 1947]). In the space of a brief two-paragraph introduction, he managed references to Herman Melville, Emily Dickinson, and “the hermit of Walden” (Henry Thoreau), before making his special brand of cultural patriotism very clear:“This issue of Dance Index presents a handful of neglected selections from well and not so well known American authors which serve to highlight a more widespread intellectual attitude toward ballet than might be thought to have then existed. The present contents point up as well the fascinating and still existing possibilities of fresh finds in forgotten tomes and bins, the last trifle ever absorbing and welcome to the devotee of the Romantic Ballet.”The final sentence expresses Cornell’s own delight in finding “trifles,” the very word so apt to describe the frothy and ephemeral fascination of the Romantic ballet. Knowledge of the ballet was also in some way Cornell’s defense against the image of a culturally barbaric nineteenth-century America, such as that caricatured by Charles Dickens in Martin Chuzzelwit (1844). Although Cornell’s enthusiasm for ballet was arguably part of a widespread fashion, it was as much the history of this art form that exerted its magic over him as it was the living dancers.Another remarkable issue of Dance Index devised by Cornell was entitled “Clowns, Elephants and Ballerinas” (Dance Index 5, 6 [June 1946]). The issue examined the curious overlap between classical dance and the circus. The poet Marian Moore, a friend and correspondent of Cornell’s, who shared his interest in natural history, contributed a defense of the elephant in the form of a review of Balanchine’s Ballet des elephants at the Barnum and Bailey Circus in 1942. In his introductory remarks to this issue, Kirstein aptly described Cornell as “brother to the scientist who recreated a whole pre-historic age from the glimpse of a dinosaur’s tooth.” The fragment whether sequin, feather, face, line of poetry, or briefest anecdote —engendered a world in Cornell’s imagination or in the dreams that were such an intimate part of his working process.Tamura Toumanova (1919–1996), to whom this collage is dedicated, was, as Lynda Hartigan has noted,“the subject of more than two dozen boxes, collages, and objects created by Cornell between 1940 and the 1960s. Introduced to Toumanova in 1940, he found in her the living counterpart to the Romantic ballerina Taglioni, as well as a woman with whom he remained deeply enamored until his death.” (Washington, D. C., National Museum of American Art, Smithsonian Institution, Joseph Cornell: An Exploration of Sources, 1982-83, exh. Cat. By Lynda Roscoe Hartigan, p. 34)He met Toumanova through Pavel Tchelitehew, a friend and fellow artist on the fringe of Surrealist circles in New York, who designed ballet sets and exchanged gifts with her (sec Dickran Tashjian, Joseph Cornel: Gifs of Desire, Miami Beach. Fla., 1992, p. 111). This collage incorporates a photograph of Toumanova with printed images of butterflies, and sea plants and creatures, evoking both an aerial and underwater world. Cornell thereby suggested that Toumanova is a star who may take her place among the constellations, alongside such mythical figures as Andromeda. The merging of ethereal blue with hints of an underwater environment may also allude to the watery settings of the ballets Swan Lake, Ondine, and Les Sylphides (for a discussion of the conditions between this collage and Cornell’s unpublished scenario for Les Sylphides, see New York 1983, exh. cat. by Sandra Leonard Starr, pp. 6O–61). The butterflies connect this work with other boxes of this period that do not have ostensible links with the ballet (Untitled [Butterfly Habitat]) .— Entry, Dawn Ades, Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1997, p.38-39.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/99793/homage-to-tamara-toumanova

His primary form became the box—solid or hollow, enclosed or open—often in exacting, serial arrays. Untitled comprises Judd’s seventh “stack,” a compositional mode that became the signature manifestation of his ideas. Every stack is installed like a spine or column, not only cantilevered out from the wall but also connecting floor to ceiling. Judd sought to banish symbolism from abstraction, intending his work to be experienced physically. This “stack” casts a lush orange glow against the wall around it; as a result, negative space is as much a part of the work as the boxes themselves.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/220158/untitled
usa_549,Ed Ruscha,Color screenprint on ivory wove paper,Standard Station,"Ed Ruscha is a California-based artist whose work is associated with the Pop art movement. Standard Station marks the first time that Ruscha collaborated with a print publisher, who financed the edition but left the execution up to the artist. Ruscha’s book of photographs Twenty-six Gasoline Stations—specifically the page depicting a Standard Oil station in Amarillo, Texas—provided the model for this print as well as a painting he made in 1963. Perhaps the most notable feature of the print version of the image is the gradation of the colors in the sky. Ruscha achieved this effect through the “Split-Fountain” technique, which blends ink to create a rainbow effect. The technique originated in commercial printing and had been used in lithographic and screenprinting shops for many years, but Ruscha was one of the first to use it in fine-art printing. As art historian Riva Castleman has pointed out, the garish rainbow effect achieved by Ruscha in this print was so often imitated by other artists that, by the late 1960s, it had become a printing cliché.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/118130/standard-station

This portrait depicts Zenobia, the queen of Palmyra, who ruled the Syrian city after her husband, Odenathus, died in A.D. 267. Zenobia conquered Egypt and much of Asia Minor before her defeat by the Roman emperor Aurelian in A.D. 272.

Turning to fashion, pop culture, and science fiction as aesthetic templates, she creates high-gloss digital dreamscapes that refer to Buddhist thought and religious iconography while presenting an optimistic vision of a technological future. Melding Eastern and Western forms and mixing transcendental themes with open appeals to visual pleasure, the artist proposes a cultural condition in which aesthetics, spirituality, and technology intermingle.Miko No Inori, which translates as the Shaman-Girl’s Prayer, is set in a digitally transformed version of Osaka’s international airport, which seems to be at once a vaulted temple and a sleek, futuristic space. As in many of her videos, Mori appears as a cyborg—a fantasy woman, half-machine, half-human—in this instance, dressed in a white, iridescent costume that complements her reflective ice blue eyes. She cradles and caresses a glass sphere while a haunting pop song plays. The figure recalls a fortune-teller with her proverbial crystal ball, but she also invites other interpretations that coexist uneasily: she can be seen as a bodhisattva—a spiritual guide who forgoes nirvana out of compassion for those who suffer—but she also resembles a model promoting a new product, gazing directly at the audience with her glass orb seductively in hand.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/184189/miko-no-inori

However, although he maintained lasting connections to Chicago, he moved permanently to Connecticut in 1918, having commenced yearly visits to the artists’ colony at Old Lyme as early as 1914. For many American Impressionists, New England towns held great appeal as a source of comfort and nostalgia.

Although the sky has faded and appears empty, X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy and FTIR analyses have yielded evidence that the artist originally painted the sky with dilute washes of chrome yellow and pink madder (both fugitive pigments), with a minute amount of vermilion, to create a glowing orange sunset. Thus, the watercolor originally showed a young boy pausing in his work of harvesting pumpkins to gaze off toward the setting sun, recalling the work of French Barbizon School artists, who influenced Homer in his early career. Their pictures of peasants pausing for a moment of contemplation at the end of their workday resonated with Homer, who showed a lifelong preference for depicting workers.Homer derived the title from an anonymous Old English song: “Though little, I’ll work as hard as a Turk, / If you’ll give me employ /To plow and sow, and reap and mow, / And be a farmer’s boy.” Interestingly, a longer version of the song includes the line “The sun went down behind yon hills,” thereby supporting findings that the watercolor originally depicted an orange sunset.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/93433/for-to-be-a-farmer-s-boy

Part of a small group of single-image paintings, this work depicts a combination of a rhinoceros and the mythical one-eyed Cyclops. Inspired by an encounter that the artist had with his favorite animal at the zoo, the artist explained: “I had some peanuts, and as I gave them to the rhino, he sucked my hand and held it. My wife got scared but I was terribly interested. He was playful and cute and toylike, but at the same time he chilled me. He seemed prehistoric and his eyes were cold and deadly.” This work was denounced as “unintelligible” by mainstream critics, but it was awarded a prize in a juried exhibition of abstract and Surrealist American art held at the Art Institute in 1947–48.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/60736/cyclops
usa_569,Jeanne Dunning,"Single-channel video, color, with sound, 30 min. loop",Icing,"Since the late 1980s, Chicago-based artist Jeanne Dunning has become known internationally for her provocative photographs and videos that employ the human body to explore gender norms, sexuality, and our visual apprehension of reality. In many of her works, she initially fosters moments of misrecognition, leading us to think that we are looking at something other than what is actually represented. The artist also often develops a degree of tension between the grotesque on the one hand and the sensual or erotic on the other.In the video Icing, the hands of an anonymous, off-screen woman are shown as she prepares a bowl of white cake frosting. Slowly, over the course of thirty minutes, she uses it to cover the head of another woman, as if decorating a cake. This cool, methodical process depersonalizes the seated woman, gradually obscuring her features. In the end, the sitter loses her individual identity, becoming instead an inert sculptural form vaguely reminiscent of a marble bust, which is accentuated by a white paper collar around the neck that effectively serves as its base. Meanwhile, the actions of the faceless pastry chef resemble the strokes of a brush or palette knife, evoking the act of painting.Notably, these allusions to classical art forms emerge through activities and materials that traditionally carry feminine, household associations, which are underscored at the end of the video as the woman washes her utensils. In this regard, Dunning’s work recalls feminist video art of the 1970s, which depicted homely activities with a sustained, concentrated focus, aiming to legitimize the place of the domestic in art. The nature of the interaction in Icing complicates this kind of practice, however, by suggesting that a fixation on supposed women’s routines can be potentially restrictive or fetishizing—not unequivocally liberating.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/184185/icing

usa_573,Louis H. Sullivan (Architect),Bronze plated cast iron,"Elevator Grille Ornament from Schlesinger and Mayer Store, Chicago, Illinois","Louis Sullivan’s vision of architecture was largely independent of historical precedent. His philosophy of architecture and ornament was based on a highly individualistic interpretation that saw the perfect building as one whose physical characteristics expressed factors unique to the building such as materials, structures, site, and function. When Sullivan applied this philosophy to the design of architectural ornament, he developed an organic style, which derived its forms from nature and geometry. This circular medallion is composed of a central cross from which four flat shields radiate, employing the sinuous geometry of his previous period as a background against which more fluid shield-shaped and organic motifs are seen.The Schlesinger and Mayer Store was Sullivan’s last large commercial commission. The department store, known since 1904 as Carson Pirie Scott and Company, attests to Sullivan’s design virtuosity. The facade’s unbroken cellular wall, composed of plate-glass windows in neat rows, rises above two floors of ornamental cast-iron work. Surrounding the street-level windows and encrusting the entrance pavilion at the corner are design motifs derived from geometry and natural forms. Sullivan carried these motifs into the interior, which richly detailed balusters contain stylized seed forms and interlaced ribbons on a background of geometric shapes. The elevator medallion was installed at the hand height on the original cage elevators, which were removed for fire safety reasons.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/36536/elevator-grille-ornament-from-schlesinger-and-mayer-store-chicago-illinois
usa_574,Arshile Gorky,Crayon with graphite and scraping on off-white wove paper,Carnival,"According to Jim Jordan, this drawing was “undoubtly the inspiration” for the painting known as Virginia Landscape, also of 1943 (fig. 2; Jordan and Goldwater 1982, pp. 82-83). It belongs to a moment when, staying on his in-laws’ farm in Virginia in 1943, Gorky turned to nature and nature’s creative forces as a point of reference. André Breton’s 1945 celebration of Gorky contains a still-timely warning, however, against making too literal a reading o a landscape in his work:“Those who love easy solutions will find slim pickings here: despite all warnings, they will continue in their attempts to discover still lifes, landscapes, and figurations in these compositions, simply because they do not have the courage to recognize the fact that all human emotions tend to be precipitated in hybird forms. By “hybird” I mean to signify the end result produced by the contemplation of a natural spectacle blended with the flux of childhood and other memories provoked by intense concentration upon this spectacle by an observer endowed with quite exceptional emotional gifts. It should, indeed, be emphasized that Gorky is unique among Surrealists painters in remaining in direct contact with nature by standing in front of it in order to paint. He is not concerned, however, with translating nature as an end in itself, but rather with extrating from its sensations capable of acting as springboards towards the deepening, in terms of consciousness as much as of enjoyment, of certain spiritual states.” (André Breton, “Arshile Gorky,” in Surrealism and Painting, tr. by Simon Watson Taylor, New York, 1972, p. 200)Gorky’s interst in Joan Miró is apparent here, though it would not be easy to pin down specific sources for Carnival. Willem de Kooning recalled that Gorky expressed admiration for Miró’s Still Life with Old Shoe (1937, New York, The Museum of Modern Art; New York, The Museum of Modern Art, Joan Miró. 1993-94, exh. cat. by Carolyn Lanchner, no. 145, ill.), which was shown by Pierre Matisse in the late 1930s (Jordan and Goldwater 1982 p. 75). Like many works by Gorky, Carnival is a composite of memories, experiences, and associations—both personal and artistic—powered by the tension between precisely outlined bud- and bodylike forms, and free, gestural passages. As Diane Waldman has written, Gorky could be described as “the last Surrealist and the first Abstract Expressionist” (New York 1981-82, p. 60)— Entry, Dawn Ades, Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1997, p. 142-143.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/118697/carnival

He acutely observed and recorded these events in his watercolors, rarely passing explicit judgment. In The Rapids, Hudson River, Adirondacks, the artist combined themes of fishing and logging. On first encounter, this watercolor is peaceful and intimate, a virtuoso study of the movement of the river’s surface over partially submerged rocks. Long, painterly strokes of black watercolor over layers of blue describe the depth and speed of the water, while areas of bright white paper have been revealed by scraping to indicate the bubbling froth of whitewater rapids. It is only along the far bank that one becomes aware of the presence of man in this tranquil landscape, implied by the clean-cut logs lying haphazardly along the rocky bank. Even more subtle is Homer’s suggestion of a fisherman’s presence, indicated by the leaping fish at river’s edge, where the artist used his knife blade to sketch the serpentine motion of a fishing line in mid-cast. The fisherman is invisible, yet we are made to understand that the presence of human beings alters nature profoundly.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16823/the-rapids-hudson-river-adirondacks

Like others in the series, this angular composition features rectilinear subdivisions of forms. A rooflike border at the top unifies the moody sky and harbor. To preserve a sense of lively crispness, the artist used black colored pencil for the preliminary sketch and moderated his use of overlapping painted and drawn lines. He also allowed this sheet to remain more literal and descriptive than other watercolors in the series. Marin may have worn himself out—or exhausted his subject—with this Deer Isle project. He stayed in Stonington for the last time the following year and then spent two summers away from the sea, working near Taos, New Mexico.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/180822/deer-isle-maine-probably-movement-no-12-boats-and-pertaining-thereto
usa_579,Ed Ruscha,Oil on canvas,City,"From his earliest experiences as a sign painter, Ed Ruscha retained an interest in the visual and conceptual tensions between text and image. By the late 1960s, the artist began using pointed, single words— chosen as much for their evocative power as for their phonetic qualities—as visual subjects in a variety of media. Between 1966 and 1969, Ruscha made a series of “liquid” or “wet” word paintings, in which the linguistic effect is made more palpable by the trompe l’oeil renderings of the words, which suggest that they have been created from water, oil, syrup, or another fluid.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/32349/city

Many of his watercolors that explore these subjects were painted on frequent trips to the Adirondack Mountains. Netting the Fish is unusual in its focus on a gentleman sportsman. Young, well groomed, and neatly attired, the fisherman in this watercolor stands in contrast to the rustic guides featured in many of the artist’s other Adirondacks works. Homer’s fluid brushstrokes describe the smooth surface of the water, and his background washes evoke the wooded shoreline seen at a distance. Netting the Fish is one of Homer’s few grisaille, or monochrome, watercolors, painted as a study of values in preparation for the etching Fly Fishing, Saranac Lake.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/14837/netting-the-fish
usa_581,Thomas Eakins,Oil on canvas mounted on board,Study for “William Rush Carving His Allegorical Figure of the Schuylkill River”,"Best known for his realist portraits and scenes of contemporary life, Thomas Eakins also spent considerable energy on history paintings. Here, he executed a study for a painting that celebrates an early American sculptor, William Rush. In the finished painting, Rush is depicted carving his Water Nymph and Bittern (1809), for which the model poses; the statue adorned a public square in Philadelphia, the hometown of both artists. Eakins, an ardent advocate of studying from life, highlights this artistic working method in his rendering of the female form. In 1870s America, artistic studies from the nude figure remained a rarity, a condition that Eakins worked hard to overturn in the following years as an instructor at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/28860/study-for-william-rush-carving-his-allegorical-figure-of-the-schuylkill-river
usa_582,John Singer Sargent,Oil on canvas,Mrs. Charles Gifford Dyer (Mary Anthony),"The sitter and her husband, the painter Charles Gifford Dyer, were part of an expatriate community of American artists that lived and worked in Europe in the late 19th century. John Singer Sargent painted this portrait during his first extended stay in Venice as a professional artist. Rather than a formal commission, the work likely served as a souvenir of friendship and shared experiences. Its relatively small scale and the background’s thin, quick brushwork suggest that Sargent completed the canvas in a single sitting. The painting’s dark tones and limited palette are reminiscent of Spanish masters such as Diego Velázquez, whom Sargent looked to in particular during his student years in the late 1870s, and indeed throughout his career.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/110879/mrs-charles-gifford-dyer-mary-anthony

Like those mountain scenes, this watercolor was constructed in horizontal bands, with an expanse of paper left nearly empty in the middle ground, where the pale stains of wiped, blotted color evoke the dull glare of the river’s surface. This free wet-into-wet application appears in numerous other Weehawken images in which Marin allowed his colors to bleed into each other, giving the scenes of river commerce the soft glow of wintry dawn light. Here Marin’s vantage point high on the riverbank encouraged him to flatten the composition; the shapes of the Weehawken piers extend upward along the picture plane rather than leading the eye into deep space.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/2911/west-shore-docks-weehawken-new-jersey

Specializing in landscape, Metcalf was greatly inspired by Impressionism, yet in this painting, he strayed from the pastel colors of that style and adopted an earthy palette with rich, russet tones. The unconventional look across, rather than along, Blow-Me-Down Brook limits the perspective, forcing the viewer to look down the banks of the brook to the clear, ice-covered water. Painted en plein air in the Cornish wilderness, the winter scenes of this series were some of Metcalf’s most celebrated and critically praised works.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/90894/icebound

He was the second generation of a family of painters; his father, Carleton Wiggins, was one of the first members of the artists’ colony in Old Lyme, Connecticut. The younger Wiggins also spent time in Old Lyme, where Snow-Crowned Hills was painted.

Shop Girls depicts female employees as they cut cloth from fabric bolts and ready them for sale. Elizabeth Sparhawk-Jones rendered this modern subject in rapid, open brushwork, paying particular attention to effects of light and atmosphere. Her work of this period often represented women in the modern city: nursemaids at home, women strolling in the park, shoppers, and store clerks.Sparhawk-Jones studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, where she learned from artists William Merritt Chase and Cecilia Beaux. She developed an energetic painting style that drew from both Realism and Impressionism.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/68517/shop-girls
usa_589,Joseph Cornell,Box construction,Nouveaux Contes de Fées (New Fairy Tales),"This box, like so many of Cornell’s constructions, elicits multiple associations. The glazed front of the box is in fact a hinged door, opening like a medicine cabinet or an old-fashioned bookcase. The neat, gridlike compartments contain tiny boxes, which are like miniature keepsake containers or perhaps jewel boxes, an impression enhanced by the pink velvet interior. Each is pasted over with pages cut from a French book or journal, whose engraved illustrations and typeface both suggest nineteenth-century text. We are invited to link these now yellowing fragments of the text to the title Nouveaux Contes de fees, which is pasted in the top left and right corners of the door frame, invoking the title page in a book of fairy tales.The box was designed as a kind of toy to be played with, for the little boxes inside can be rearranged at will. Cornell’s choice of a French publication with which to cover them, together with the images, evokes French novels, which at the time to which the illustrations belong could signify the illicit and the erotic, and were considered unsuitable reading for young ladies. Although this is belied by the title, an aura of the secretive remains. This work is most closely related to Cornell‘s Untitled (Paul and Virginia) of c. 1946–48 (Chicago, Bergman family; see New York 1980-82, pl. IX), which similarly combines engravings and pages of text with mysterious stacks of tiny, closed boxes. In the latter, Cornell used pages from an English edition of Bernardin de Saint-Pierre’s Paul et Virginie (1789) together with engravings that originally accompanied the Curmer edition of 1838. This hugely successful tragic love story of the Romantic era may well have had an additional appeal for Cornell because it was set in the New world. The austere, grid structure of Nouveaux Contes de fees, which is emphasized by the simple, geometric shapes of the boxes and is related to Cornell’s Dovecote series, is in striking contrast to the romantic and rather sugary images.— Entry, Dawn Ades, Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1997, p.48-49.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/99778/nouveaux-contes-de-fees-new-fairy-tales

Many of his important early works, such as Art Make-Up, grew out of his involvement with experimental film and video in the 1960s, in which the artist often used his own body as the vehicle for exploration. Here Nauman applied colored makeup—white, pink, green, and finally black—in successive layers to his face and torso. Art Make-Up introduces the themes of surveillance and masking that recur in the artist’s later work. His entire oeuvre can be read as a self-conscious investigation into the conditions and possibilities of art making.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/47147/art-make-up
usa_592,Marsden Hartley,Oil on cardboard,The Last of New England—The Beginning of New Mexico,"In this painting, Marsden Hartley depicted an imagined scene in which the fallen trees of a New England forest in the foreground transition to the golden hills of New Mexico beyond. Weary of the East Coast, the artist spent 18 months in the Southwest in 1918–19, believing that he could find rejuvenation in nature. Here, thick black lines define the Southwestern landscape, which he saw as alive with expressive potential. He wrote to Alfred Stieglitz, “I like the country very well, for it is big and clean and true, and there is nothing dirty standing between one and the sunlight, as there is in the east.” Like many artists who lived in New England at this time, he pictured the Southwest as uninhabited and unspoiled, overlooking the centuries of civilizations in the region.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/65925/the-last-of-new-england-the-beginning-of-new-mexico

Marin made these landmarks identifiable, adding color over his graphite sketch with broad but carefully applied strokes. He used a heavy blue pigment that settled into the low points of the paper’s surface and lightly blotted the wet blue wash at upper left, removing just enough color from the high points to accentuate the grainy pattern left behind. At lower left, he used more water, rewetting and then blotting his colors to approximate the obliterating effect of steam emanating from street vents. Using a soft, dark pencil, he outlined the structures and delineated architectural details, adding heads and shoulders to blue dabs of wash to transform them into figures.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/2902/street-scene

In Slumber Party a young boy and girl in various states of undress prepare for bed. The boy appears absorbed by the television rather than by the girl behind him. While this could be simply a benign bedtime ritual, we cannot shake the question of what will happen next.

Edition number seven of ten",Splitting,"Gordon Matta-Clark is best known for bold, unconventional drawings, films, photographs, and sculptures relating to the built environment. The son of Surrealist painter Roberto Matta, he studied architecture at Cornell University from 1962 to 1968; there, he met sculptor Robert Smithson, whose interests in land art and the theory of entropy influenced him significantly. After completing his studies, he moved to New York and became a well-known figure among artists in the burgeoning avant-garde scene centered in Soho. Matta-Clark’s principal contribution was as a radical sculptor: he is recognized for his series of “building cuts” (1972–78), in which he carved out sections of entire structures, treating them as spatial compositions. Calling these transformations “Anarchitecture,” the artist documented them in films and photographs that were subsequently exhibited in galleries, often alongside fragments of the buildings themselves.One of his most celebrated sculptures consisted of a vertical slice into an old frame house located in Englewood, New Jersey. The home, owned by New York art dealer Holly Solomon, was slated for demolition. The resulting film is composed of intentionally artless footage showing Matta-Clark and his friends making two parallel cuts down the center of the house; jacking up one half of the structure and beveling the cinderblock supporting it; and then lowering that half back down, bisecting the home and creating an ephemeral display of light inside the once-compartmentalized interior. The movie’s documentary style is the result of the artist’s dramatically physical approach to filmmaking. It reveals Matta-Clark as a daredevil, climbing around a structure that has nothing but a few jacks preventing it from collapse. The sequences, which study the light effects produced by the building cut, reveal a domestic space transformed into a sundial on a grand scale.After he created Splitting, Matta-Clark invited select members of the art com-munity to travel by bus to the home and see it firsthand, an act that was not without some physical risk to the out-of-place gallery-goers. Three months later, the house was leveled. While the majority of the artist’s projects were only meant to exist temporarily, films such as Splitting preserve the ephemeral nature of his approach and also remain as important works of art in their own right. Indeed, Splitting has been remembered as “one of the premier moments of a period in which anarchistic, architecturally oriented sculpture coexisted with Conceptual art.” During his short career––he died of cancer at age thirty-five—Matta-Clark made over twenty films documenting his architectural explorations and interventions; these have become an extremely important influence for contemporary artists such as Matthew Barney, Pierre Huyghe, and Rachel Whiteread.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/187171/splitting

Abigail Inskeep Bradford belonged to a prestigious Philadelphia family; her father served as the city’s mayor (1800–01 and 1805–06) and her brother, John Inskeep, presided over a successful publishing business. Unlike Peale’s portrait of her husband, Samuel Fisher Bradford (1986.21), in this work Abigail looks away from the viewer, avoiding a direct gaze.

The artist recognized the potential of the inexpensive, mass-produced gold beads; indeed, he possessed an uncanny ability to produce elegant and restrained forms out of otherwise common materials. The beads conjure at once the pop or hippie culture of the late 1960s and 1970s as well as the glitz of opulence.

usa_611,Jenny Holzer,"Six double-sided vertical light-emitting diode signs with Taitron blue diodes, stainless steel housings and bezels",Blue Tilt,"Since the 1970s, Jenny Holzer has used language as her medium of choice to communicate penetrating ideas about life and death, sex, power, and war. Like contemporaries including Barbara Kruger, Sherrie Levine, and Cindy Sherman, she appropriates mass media and advertising strategies in her work. Holzer rose to prominence with her Truisms series (1977–79), which consisted of nearly three hundred aphorisms and slogans that play on commonly held truths and clichés such as “A lot of professionals are crackpots” and “A man can’t know what it is like to be a mother.” Displayed as anonymous broadsides on buildings, fences, and walls throughout Manhattan, these statements were meant to provoke public debate. In her more recent work, Holzer continues to use language and current modes of communication to assail established ideas about art’s place, audience, and meaning in modern society. Her texts have appeared on benches, billboards, Internet sites, posters, sarcophagi, in the form of monumental Xenon projections, and, most commonly, as LED (light-emitting diode) signs.Blue Tilt features texts from five of Holzer’s iconic series: Truisms; Inflammatory Essays (1979–82), one hundred words in twenty lines inspired by the literature of Emma Goldman, Rosa Luxembourg, Lenin, Mao, and others, also printed on posters; Living (1980–82), matter-of-fact writings on “everyday life with a twist” that were originally shown on cast-bronze plaques and hand-lettered metal signs; the urgent Survival (1983–85), which appeared on the Spectacolor board in New York’s Times Square and was the first series the artist conceived for electronic signs; and the desperate Under A Rock (1986), which was engraved on stone benches shortly after Holzer’s move to the countryside of upstate New York. Although all of these texts are the artist’s invention, they do not necessarily reflect her personal views. Indeed, they employ a variety of contradictory voices, assuming a tone of anonymous authority in order to express a wide spectrum of biases and beliefs in which truth is relative. Blue Tilt captures each of these signature moments in the medium most readily associated with Holzer—the LED.The structure of Blue Tilt’s installation is architectural and dramatic, with imposing sixteen-foot, double-sided signs towering over viewers and bathing the entire space in the light of a relentless stream of words. “One reason I’ve stayed with LEDs so long,” remarked Holzer, “is that part of the experience is that the light and words hit the body. This might give you vertigo; it might represent that there’s always too much information and ‘how do I process it?’ It could make you unsure of the floor; I try to use reflections to that end.” Under her control, the gallery becomes a stage that at once creates and serves an audience that can no longer make itself comfortable.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/190590/blue-tilt

In this painting, which evokes the Parisian interiors of such French artists as Édouard Manet, Bellows depicted his mother in a large chair in the Victorian parlor of their family home in Columbus, Ohio. This forthright presentation of a distinguished, elderly woman with a strong character, coupled with the subdued palette, also recalls the portraiture of Thomas Eakins, whom Bellows greatly admired. The painting’s power derives in part from its highly structured composition. Influenced by the artist Jay Hambidge’s theory of dynamic symmetry, Bellows constructed the portrait in an organized, geometric arrangement of proportionate rectangles and triangles.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/9320/my-mother

The artist’s best-known paintings belong to the Ocean Park series—named for the section of Santa Monica wherehis studio was located—which he began in 1967 and continued for 20 years. The series comprises more than 140 paintings. These iconic works are distinguished by geometric structures, perhaps evoking the idea of a view from the studio window, overlaid with glazes of atmospheric color.

This box forms an interesting contrast with the other Soap Bubble Set in the Bergman collection (see Soap Bubble Set). Here the bold form of the moon fills the back panel, its pitted surface finding an echo in the cork ball suspended on the parallel rods. Like the earlier box, this one includes a drinking glass. A clay pipe lying on the floor of the box forges the link between the “bubbles” and the planets. Cornell seems to wish to counteract, however, the obviously poetic, dreamlike connotations of this box by emphasizing the scientific interest of the moon through its precisely “mapped” surface and the tables with astronomical data pasted in at the left and right.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/99769/untitled-soap-bubble-set

This painting depicts a subject from James Fenimore Cooper’s 1827 novel The Prairie, the third of the five Leatherstocking Tales. In this scene, Natty Bumppo, the hero of the series, has created a firebreak to protect the story’s protagonists. As a Romantic-era artist, Fisher preferred such dramatic episodes, which involved striking contrasts between light and dark. Unlike contemporaneous illustrations of the scene, which give little sense of setting, in this version the figures are dwarfed by nature, and the prairie grasses are exquisitely rendered, underscoring the landscape’s beauty as well as its dangers. The work thus suggests the significance of the prairie in Cooper’s text. Perhaps for this reason, the author declared that it was “the only good illustration he had seen from his books.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/196282/the-prairie-on-fire

In his trips into the countryside, he would often gather materials for his boxes, and in this one, the large, angular piece of bark placed toward the right interior edge may be the lump Cornell reported finding in January 1948 and described as “magnificently dried bark for owl bark, single piece, for owl boxes” (Cornell 1993, p. 152). In any case it adds a sense of depth to the box by providing a kind of opened curtain, from behind which the owl is revealed. The sheet of blue glass renders the interior as dark as a forest at night, and the small electric bulb above, when lit, suggests moonlight. The dramatic chiaroscuro effect prompts comparison with photography, as well as underlining the contrast between the two-dimensional pictorial representation of the owl and its “real” habitat. The numerous worm holes in the wood frame are the result of simulated rather than authentic insect damage and appear to be original to the box‘s construction.

Her work explores the pervasive effects that mass-media images have upon the construction, assumption, and projection of individual identities. Since the late 1970s, the artist has served as both photographer and model for a large cast of fictional personalities created through changes in costume, hair (usually a wig), makeup, and lighting. Sherman first gained recognition for a series of black-and-white works that imitate the look and feel of stills from popular films of the 1950s and 1960s. In 1981 she began a series of large color photographs that mimic the horizontal format of a magazine centerfold. Though formally reminiscent of such glossy spreads, Sherman’s representations are fraught with anxiety, vulnerability, and longing. In Untitled #92, she depicted herself in a moment of cinematic distress, crouched on the floor with wet hair. Her costume—white blouse and plaid skirt—evokes a school uniform, and her well-manicured hands offer evidence of some unknown struggle. An imposing darkness surrounds her but a bright light, suggestive of a flashlight or the headlights of a car, illuminates her blank expression.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/229389/untitled-92

Twombly made the dynamic, brooding Untitled as one in a suite of fourteen large-scale paintings during the summer of 1969 while ensconced at Palazzo del Drago on the shores of Lake Bolsena in central Italy. Against a rich, creamy ground, he elaborated on the cascades of planar and tubular shapes that had emerged in his painting the year before, using diagram-like forms to imbue the canvas with a sense of spatiotemporal flow, as well as a certain airiness. On the other hand, the white field—darkened here and there by passages of erasure—also takes on the aspect of a heavily revised mathematical worksheet. Twombly was immersed both in his work and in his particular location, titling these paintings with the place-name Bolsena. But while typically he might find inspiration in the history of his ancient rural retreat, in this case he was as attuned to that summer’s defining moment: the Apollo II moon landing.

Here Dickinson depicted magazines, a sake bottle, a tea canister painted with Japanese figures, and a cup and saucer. His composition employs a tilted perspective reminiscent of Paul Cézanne’s still lifes, a Cubist fracturing of space, and the bold, complementary colors typical of American Synchromists like Stanton MacDonald-Wright.

usa_681,Joseph Cornell,Box construction,Pavilion,"Cornell crated complex spatial and visual effects in Pavilion by using fragments of mirrors in various positions within the construction. These allow for different views of the interior as the spectator changes position. This is particularly true of the mirror on the bottom of the wood shelf a long the top of the right interior wall, which gives a view of the interior of the box as if seen from above. These mirror fragments also vary greatly in shape. As noted in the above media description, there are four fragments of mirror on the rear interior wall: the tips of the two long, curved fragments, which look like sickle moons, almost touch; a third piece, in the lower left corner, is roughly triangular; and the fourth fragment is straight.The title, Pavilion, evokes the in-between space of a tent or garden structure from which the heavens can be observed. The ambiguity between interior and exterior is often part of the mysterious power of Cornell‘s boxes; here, the moon-shaped mirror fragments create a circular opening through which the constellations are seen, but the “pavilion” could also be the “tent” of the sky itself.— Entry, Dawn Ades, Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1997, p.68-69.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/99779/pavilion

The left and right sections of the triptych are halves of a single photograph, while the central portion represents a montage of three other pictures taken at the plant.

usa_694,Max Ernst,Oil on canvas,The Blue Forest,"Max Ernst was one of the most materially inventive artists associated with Surrealism, exhibiting a protean imagination that led him to produce work in an unusually wide range of styles and techniques. This painting belongs to a period, from 1925 to 1928, that was perhaps the most productive and creative of his long career. Most of the artist’s extraordinarily rich work of these years depended, directly or indirectly, on a technique referred to as frottage (rubbing), which Ernst used to stimulate his imagination, encouraged in this by Surrealist theories about the processes of inspiration. This technique consisted in placing a piece of paper over a textured object or surface and then rubbing it with a pencil or other tool to obtain an image. Using this method as his point of departure, Ernst produced in 1925 a series of exceptionally beautiful drawings, thirty-four of which were published the following year under the title Histoire naturelle (Natural History). This painting shares with these drawings a stark and delicate beauty. Like many other works of this period, it was produced by adapting frottage to oil painting. The techniques used included scraping paint off the canvas, a procedure Ernst called grattage (scraping), or rubbing a cloth dipped in paint over the canvas, as it lay on a variety of textured surfaces from wood planks and wire mesh, as in this case, to string, chair caning, shells, and many other materials. As the title of Ernst’s portfolio of drawings indicates, many of his works of these years allude to the natural world. The “Forest” series, exemplified by this painting, resumed a popular Romantic theme that continued to fascinate Surrealist artists(compare, for example, the work of Ernst’s close friend Jean Arp) as a repository of mysterious, primeval forces.Here the chance patterns produced by the wood grain of several wood planks have been transformed into a cluster of towering forms, outlined against a pale sky flecked with blue, yellow, and green. The forest’s floor presents a honeycomb pattern seemingly produced by means of a wire mesh, a pattern that is echoed in the sky in scattered bursts of color. The spare simplicity of this image enhances its associative powers, as we are drawn into our own cosmic reverie about a primordial world, encompassing far more than the forest mentioned in the title. Ernst’s works thus become, in his own words, a kind of “hypnotic language [that] takes us back to a lost paradise, to cosmic secrets, and teaches us to understand the language of the universe.”—Entry, Margherita Andreotti, Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies, Vol. 20, No. 2, The Joseph Winterbotham Collection at The Art Institute of Chicago (1994), p. 158-159.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/71982/the-blue-forest

usa_696,Kiki Smith,Ink on gampi paper,Untitled,"Kiki Smith has been instrumental in shifting the abstract rhetoric of the human form in art into a grounded conversation about the body, particularly as it is defined in social and political terms. Her figurative sculpture examines the physical and spiritual nature of the body by presenting it in an abject, fragmented, and damaged state. Untitled, which is one of only a few sculptures by Smith that investigates the male form, is executed in tissue-thin gampi paper—a fragile and ephemeral material—to convey the porous and permeable quality of skin. Here, as in much of Smith’s work, the artist engaged viewers in issues of individual and collective health and disease, heroization and victimization, and life and death.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/146895/untitled

usa_701,Elizabeth Murray,Oil on two canvases,Back on Earth,"Beginning in 1976, Elizabeth Murray developed a reputation for her brightly colored, sculptural, shaped canvases, which illustrate objects and figures from her daily life. Influenced by Cubism, Abstract Expressionism, and comic art, her vibrant and energetic visual language playfully complicates the formal attributes of painting. In Back on Earth, two grandly scaled canvases—one geometric (blue), the other biomorphic (green)—are inextricably linked by the artist’s assertive use of color and rambunctious imagery. The animated, squidlike table is a recurring motif in Murray’s paintings and is utilized here to visually link the canvases and to further confound the relationship between figure and ground.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/97410/back-on-earth
usa_702,Andy Warhol,"Silkscreen ink on primed linen, twelve joined canvases",Twelve Jackies,"Pop artist Andy Warhol’s fascination with fame and his complicated veneration of popular culture permeated every aspect of his career. Early on he adopted the commercial printing process of photoemulsion silk screen applied to canvas as a means of reproducing the same image, over and over, quickly and efficiently. His studio became known as the Factory, a reference to his preference for mass production. He embraced both household goods and Hollywood personalities, rendering Campbell’s Soup cans and Coca-Cola bottles as stars, Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor as products, and vice versa. He also recognized that notoriety could be found even in tragedy. Twelve Jackies comes from a body of work created shortly after the 1963 assassination of President John F. Kennedy. As was his practice, Warhol worked from existing imagery; in this case, press photography from the slain president’s funeral. By cropping and enlarging the selected image of the veiled former First Lady, Warhol focuses attention on his “star” much like a director using a close-up lens. The effect is a chilling glamorization of the tragic. Warhol’s use of repetition not only emphasizes the feeling of mourning and loss but also imports a cinematic quality to the work. This emphasis parallels the artist’s interest in the language of film as well as his growing involvement at this time in the world of underground cinema.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/229356/twelve-jackies

His work is also charged with the purely sculptural tensions that exist between surface and interior, armature and appendage, and or size and scale. With Boy, Ray created a particularly disquieting figure. The sculpture stands just shy of six feet tall, the artist’s exact height, yet maintains the softness of youth in its rounded cheeks and limbs. The boy is clad in outdated garments, hovering “between baby and Hitleryouth,” in the words of one critic. Additionally, the boy’s pose and gesture suggest a confrontational manner at odds with his neutral face.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/229375/boy

A cofounder of the Black Emergency Cultural Coalition (BECC) in 1969, Andrews was increasingly categorized as a “protest artist.”Flag Day can be read as a harbinger of two later projects—a program Andrews organized through the BECC to teach art to inmates in New York City prisons, and a large body of work from the early 1970s he made to mark America’s bicentennial.

Dove began exploring it in depth, producing canvases such as Cross and Weather Vane. The composition incorporates trees, rolling hills, and the round orb of the sun—all natural elements that recur with frequency in the artist’s work. These features mingle harmoniously with the manmade objects in the painting, such as the arrow-shaped weather vane, which seems to take flight like a bird. The small brown cross, positioned against a gray, rocklike form, represents Dove’s belief in the interconnectedness of spirituality and nature.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/65893/cross-and-weather-vane

An avid circus visitor, he enjoyed the spectacle and sketching the animals. Marin loved the elephants most, responding to the dignity and grandeur of their movements. He began this watercolor by drawing the creatures and their surroundings with graphite and crayon. He then painted the forms with transparent watercolor, returning to add black crayon for the deepest lines. Painted, drawn, and subtracted diagonal marks conjure the effect of spotlights. The soft effect of wiping also contributes to the overall impression of dust hanging in the illuminated air, enhancing the artist’s evocation of heat, smells, and sounds.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/66103/circus-elephants

Imbued with the quiet mood of a Whistler nocturne, this watercolor also utilizes an important motif from Chinese painting: the artist suggested the spiky branches of a bare tree with strokes of black watercolor, gracefully balancing and screening the view of the distant skyline. The riverbank at Weehawken was a site Marin knew from his youth; that he was drawn back to it for this perspective on the metropolis bears out his statement, “As for subject matter—I go places intimate to me and in those intimate places I start to paint my painting.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/2917/weehawken-new-jersey

Hesse created Untitled when she was only 24, and as such it represents a key early work in her career.This vivid canvas, with its active, gestural strokes, marks Hesse’s emergence at a moment when Abstract Expressionist painting was still dominant. Around this time she was painting abstracted portraits, and the central orange shape here almost appears like a head in profile.

Fishing Off Scarborough shows two young women and two fishermen in a coble as it slices through coastal waters. Carefully rendered in graphite, the figures and fishing boat stand in contrast to Homer’s spontaneous, abstract representation of clouds, mist, and spray done in opaque white watercolor. In addition to employing graphite to describe concrete objects, Homer used his pencil to suggest abstract effects, such as smoke rising from the steamship in the right background. Fishing Off Scarborough served as the basis for Homer’s 1883 watercolor, Returning Fishing Boats, which the artist completed after his return to New York from England.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16788/fishing-off-scarborough

usa_744,David Smith,Stainless steel,Cubi VII,"David Smith was among the first American artists to master the use of steel and other industrial materials. After many years of working metal into evocative linear compositions, he forged a new, formal language for sculpture through increased focus on shape, volume, surface, and structure. Cubi VII is part of a series executed in the four years that preceded his untimely death in 1965; the twenty-eight sculptures are most known for their use of industrial stainless steel. While the spare, sleek forms of the Cubi series relate them to Minimalist sculpture of the 1960s, the works also reflect the artist’s connection to Abstract Expressionism in the gestural quality of their wire-brushed surfaces and their attendant emotive power. Its abstract qualities intact, Cubi VII also seems to allude to the human figure. Indeed, the large, central form and adjacent shapes evoke a torso with limbs. Yet when one walks around the sculpture, it becomes less a symbol of the human form than a vehicle for exploring the relationship between architectonic volumes and the space surrounding them. Despite its solidity, the piece appears to have no fixed center, and its elements seem precariously positioned, challenging accepted notions of balance. The reflective, burnished surfaces of Cubi VII pick up the shifting light of its outdoor site—the Art Institute’s north garden on Michigan Avenue.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/22395/cubi-vii

Bather/Night is part of a recent series that explores the somewhat well-worn art-historical theme of a woman in nature—a new subject for the artist. Specifically, this piece depicts a woman bathing, a theme that recalls classic depictions by Paul Cézanne, Edgar Degas, and Pierre Bonnard. Shown in severe foreshortening, a female nude bends forward under a night sky inspired by the painter Vincent van Gogh, splashing herself with water as her geisha-style hair blends into the background. As Dunham explained, “It’s almost similar to the way you might simultaneously be having the most intimate look at someone’s body parts and out the other side of your eye you see a tree way off in the distance—that collision of subjects and that collision of space.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/202218/bather-night

Composed of a cascading arrangement of biomorphic forms, this striking wood construction conveys the compositional balance and rhythm that Shaw, an early member of the American Abstract Artists group, sought in his nonobjective works. Equally important, Relief is neither a painting nor a sculpture, but rather a hybrid of the two. The wood pieces enter the viewer’s space even as the work remains attached to the wall, the traditional realm of painting. Relief can therefore be seen as part of the ongoing modernist endeavor to challenge the two-dimensionality of the picture plane.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/186680/relief

usa_765,Joseph Cornell,Box construction,Untitled (Harlequin),"Cornell’s early transition from collage into three-dimensional assemblage and his experiments with the possibilities of movement were often, as here, accompanied by a theatrical element. “Shadow Boxes,” as Cornell called some of his constructions of this period, were among the categories of objects named on the cover of the announcement for Cornell’s Exhibition of Objects at Julien Levy’s in December of 1940. Among the scattered illustrations on this cover is an image of Jean Antoine Watteau’s Gilles (c . 1718, Paris Musée du Louvre; Humphrey Wine. Watteau, London, 1992, pp.56–57, ill.), cut up and arranged to look like an articulated marionette, in a manner similar to the marionette in this box.Toy shadow-box theaters were popular in the United States in the latter part of the nineteenth century and were a simpler version of the miniature toy theaters that were especially popular in Europe. As Lynda Hartigan explained,“sold in sets or as separate sheets of hand-colored prints of characters, scenery, and the stage itself, miniature theaters were marketed as educational toys and pastimes to be cut out and assembled at home. The shadow-box toy was less complicated than the miniature theater in structure and frequently included [as in this box by Cornell] single figures of performers and animals that could be manipulated to create a sense of action” (Lynda Roscoe Hartigan, in Washington, D. C. 1982–83, p. 29).Halfway between a box and a collage, this work similarly combines elements of a game and of a stage. The pattern of the colored wrapping paper covering the outside of the box and visible along the edges of the glass front is reminiscent of Roman and Italian Renaissance mosaic floors. It creates an optical illusion of cubes that read either as convex or concave and also resembles the diamond-patterned costume of Harlequin from the commedia dell ‘arte.The inside walls of the box are covered with colored paper of a more muted, leafy pattern. A mat board, at the center of which has been cut a large opening, is placed directly behind the glass to create the effect of a stage, its edges decorated with paper cutouts of rococo swirls and acanthus leaf patterns appropriate to the romantic theater. The articulated marionette inside the box is suspended from a string extending out of a tiny hole in the top of the box. Pulling the string changes the marionette’s position, which may be secured using a tiny wood shim lodged in the hole. The marionette is articulated at shoulders, hips, and knees, while its head and trunk remain rigid. The figure is constructed of pieces of fiberboard; Cornell covered some of these with photostated paper, others with paper bearing geometric designs in ink of his own making.There is some disagreement about the identity of the Marionette; often described as Harlequin, because of its diamond costume, it also has the flounced collar and cone shaped hat of Pierrot, a clown, or a Punchinello figure. Harlequin is typically depicted wearing a black tricorn, The conflation of these two characters may derive from a jack-in-the-box toy. Cornell may also have intended some reference to the revival of commedia dell ‘arte imagery in the work of European artists like Pablo Picasso and Gino Severini during the 1920s, which was seen as part of a reaction against modernism and a return to a classical tradition. Although aware of this, Cornell is more likely, in a manner typical or his multi-layered references to art history and his personal memories, to have had in mind the stock figures of the Italian theater as they became part of popular tradition during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, from Watteau’s Gilles to the shadow-box theater.— Entry, Dawn Ades, Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1997, p.34-35.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/99764/untitled-harlequin

(40.6 x 137.2 x 167.6 cm), niche recessed into wall; edition 1 of 2, plus 1 artist's proof",Inasmuch As It Is Always Already Taking Place,"Gary Hill’s video installations investigate the complex relationship between language and images. In the 1970s, Hill experimented first with sound installations and then a video recorder. In the 1980s, alongside other video artists such as Bruce Nauman and Bill Viola, he began to focus on the technical capabilities of the medium rather than its aesthetic qualities, seeking to create a meditative space where he could explore issues of authorship, consciousness, and semiotics.Like other works by Hill, Inasmuch As It Is Always Already Taking Place is an amalgam of visual, structural, and sound components. The piece consists of sixteen staggered, uncased monitors that display life-size male body parts, pages of a book being thumbed, and a page with text that is too small to read. Varying in size from one-quarter inch (an eyepiece of a video camera) to twenty-three inches (the size of a ribcage), the screens, with their exposed, nervelike wires, are recessed into a five-foot niche that is set below eye level. The fragmented figure’s subtle movements are juxtaposed with nearly inaudible speech, primitive sounds of groaning, smacking noises, finger tapping, rippling water, and gun shots. Moving in close enough to decipher the sound, the viewer hears intermittent statements including “It was only an idea” and “I couldn’t say it any other way,” as if the body has its own language.Rooted in Poststructuralist theory, including the work of French philosopher Maurice Blanchot and others, Hill’s practice merges the visual and literary arts. As he has said, “My preoccupation with language began with very sculptural notions coming out of sound, the body, utterance and speaking.” In Inasmuch As It Is Always Already Taking Place, Hill adds a layer of language and deconstructs his own body, focusing on the scene as a whole rather than on each individual image. The dismembered body is decidedly self-referential, appearing as a random pile, or, as Hill put it, “a kind of debris.” Abstracted, it exudes a sensation of presence and absence, having become barely recognizable despite its close-up detail. On one level, Hill seems to be challenging a notion of masculine authority by revealing and fracturing an image of male nudity.Unmoored from their usual spatial and temporal relationship to one another, these body parts are treated almost as a still life or landscape painting. Indeed, the work can be seen as a vanitas image; the visceral sounds and the barely moving, harshly lit figure are the only signs of life and thus serve as reminders of its transience—and perhaps also of the impermanent nature of electronic media. This disturbing and complex video installation suggests many dichotomies: being and knowing, self and other, private and public, reality and imagination.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/146516/inasmuch-as-it-is-always-already-taking-place

He often drew and painted the women of the village, as they watched and waited on the shore, eyes always trained on the frequently treacherous sea. The Watcher, Tynemouth emphasizes the woman’s loneliness and anxiety as she faces the raw forces of nature. Homer chose to represent the woman with her back to the viewer. She is clad in dark blue and reddish-brown clothing, and her face is obscured by a headscarf, so as to shield her from probing eyes. The muted palette of this watercolor—overcast blue-gray sky, murky green and blue waves—exaggerates the stark whiteness of the foamy caps on the waves. Their peaks punctuate the horizon line, as do the sails of the two boats in the distance.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16840/the-watcher-tynemouth

He initially worked in a more traditional style, but while studying in Paris in 1911, he met his future wife Marguerite Thompson, who pushed him toward a more avant-garde aesthetic. In 1913 the couple rented a house in Chappaqua, New York, where Zorach painted Summer. This rare, early canvas shows Zorach’s love for the organic forms of nature and his exuberant use of color. The image of four languid nudes in a pastoral setting creates a splendid vision of the artistic life, while the often nonnaturalistic hues draw attention to the abstracted, patterned surface. Both in subject matter and style, Summer reveals the artist’s admiration for the work of Henri Matisse, which he would have seen in Paris and at the 1913 Armory Show.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/130520/summer-recto

While there, de Kooning began working with clay and, over the course of the next couple of weeks, made a series of small-scale figures, one of which Emanuel cast in bronze. Encouraged by the sculptor Henry Moore, de Kooning continued creating works that he called “painting in three dimensions.” The heavy, exaggerated form of Head #3 recalls the contorted figures from de Kooning’s paintings. Reflecting on his sculptures, the artist stated: “In some ways, clay is even better than oil. You can work and work on a painting but you can’t start over again with the canvas like it was before you put the first stroke down… . But with clay … if I don’t like what I did, or I changed my mind, I can break it down and start over. It’s always fresh.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/48509/head-3

For the first time, the artist worked with little or no graphite underdrawing, painting his most freely worked watercolors to date and communicating his feeling of energy and joy in the environment. Here Marin applied bright, transparent washes with rapid gestures and plenty of water, emphasizing the contour of a hill with an outline of bright yellow pigment that would become one of his trademarks.

The resulting sequence of near-total abstractions seems devoid of sense or purpose. The “return to reason” in the film comes finally in the form of a woman’s torso—modeled by cabaret personality Kiki de Montparnasse—turning to and fro beside a rain-covered windowpane. Man Ray reproduced the seductive finale, as well as other moments from the film, as photographs, singly and in strips.

For example, he explored a novel, indirect means of outlining the top of the Singer Building, painting a round blue stroke and, before the wash dried, touching his rag or blotting paper to its center and wicking out the wet color, leaving only the outline behind.

A few years later they entered into a passionate affair, and they eventually married in 1924. Stieglitz felt revitalized by the relationship, and in a growing fascination with seriality he produced over 300 photographs of O’Keeffe to form a kind of composite portrait: in front of her paintings, in isolated fragments, and in the intimate poses of a paramour, as seen here. In 1921 Stieglitz exhibited a print of this image at the Anderson Galleries in New York, in a one-person show that included some 40 portraits of O’Keeffe. Years later, when O’Keeffe looked back at the pictures, she remarked, “It is as if in my one life I have lived many lives.”For more on the Alfred Stieglitz collection at the Art Institute, along with in-depth object information, please visit the website: The Alfred Stieglitz Collection.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/66435/georgia-o-keeffe

usa_802,Joseph Cornell,Box construction,Untitled (Hôtel de la Duchesse-Anne),"This box has formal similarities to Yellow Chamber in its use of white panels and in its balance between asymmetry and regularity. It also includes similar components: the bird, the metal springs, the ring, and the metal rod. But the idea of travel is more strongly evoked here, not least through the contrast between the white interior of the box and the tiny, brilliantly colored stamps, which are colorful and exotic in both a metaphoric and literal sense. The contrast between their small scale and the expanse of whiteness also suggests geographic distance. The idea of the box as a surrogate for travel is indeed very present here. Some of the openings in the white lattice at the right contain bingo chips, which conjure ocean voyages where deck games and gambling played a large part in the entertainment provided on board. Other lattice openings contain wood blocks with constellations on a blue background, which similarly recall navigation. The parrot contributes to the exotic atmosphere and introduces an element of tension, as it suggests both the freedom of travel and a bird caged or trapped. A coiled spring curls over the bird’s head to form a target like shape, while the bird itself seems to eye the butterfly and beetles on the stamps as if they might become its lunch.The names of two hotels are included in this box: the Hotel des Voyageurs in Brest, a port in Brittany, and the Hotel dc la Duchesse-Anne in Nantes. The latter may have appealed to Cornell because of its association with the Surrealists: Andre Breton had spent part of World War I in Nantes, where he met Jacques Vache, whose anarchic humor had a strong influence on him. The name Anne also recalls one of Cornell’s favorite heroines, Thomas De Quincey’s Ann (see Ann—in Memory).— Entry, Dawn Ades, Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1997, p. 85.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/99789/untitled-hotel-de-la-duchesse-anne

usa_810,Joseph Cornell,Box construction with painted glass,Untitled (Crystal Cage),"The grid of this austere box is compellingly architectural, as is often the case with Cornell‘s boxes of the 1950s (see, for example, Dovecote). The interior is painted white and cracked as if with age, and the rear wall is entirely covered with a mirror. The effect of the reflections in the mirror behind is to suggest a scale and depth greater than in actuality. The torn remnants of painted paper around the edges of the twenty compartments resemble the white paint applied to new shop windows, or even the frosting of shop windows at Christmas. This casual or decorative effect contrasts with the geometric complexity of the box. The rather elegant frame, which has miter joints instead of the butt joints of many other boxes, also works against the miniature architectural effect, enclosing it like a picture.In spite of the similarity in structure with Nouveaux Contes de fees, there is no suggestion here of stacks or shelves to house and order things; whereas that box suggests a wealth of treasures within, hidden from sight, this is bleak and empty. The mirror, however, reflects the viewer, and recalls Cornell‘s fascination with the ambiguity of shop windows, which reflect the window gazer and confuse inside and out side.The letters WiNd, followed by a period, are roughly lettered on the inner side of the glass. They recall the use of lettering in Georges Braque’s and Pablo Picasso‘s Cubist paintings, which simultaneously emphasized the work’s surface and gave an often ambiguous clue to its subject. As in Cubist lettering, where journal was often shortened to jour, this word could be a truncated allusion to “window,” as well as a reference to the “wind” blowing outside.— Entry, Dawn Ades, Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1997, p. 70.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/99767/untitled-crystal-cage

Anahita was an important Persian nature deity, probably derived from Babylonian mythology, who was identified with Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love. Although the poem describes Anahita fleeing the dawn in her chariot, Hunt did not actually include the deity in this relief. He probably created the relief as a study for his murals in the New York State Capitol, in Albany.

Attracted to her muscular physique, which reminded him of Michelangelo’s rendering of the female figure, Mapplethorpe began a collaboration with her that culminated in the 1983 book Lady, Lisa Lyon. Depicting Lyon in nude, full-body portraits as well as a variety of character roles—society woman, dominatrix, mystic—this series celebrates ideals of female beauty from Antiquity and the Renaissance while simultaneously challenging stereotypical femininity today.

The empty seats and trapeze bars suggest the excitement to come, when spectators and acrobats fill the theater.Beal’s portrayal of a group of circus clowns in the foreground includes one figure who appears to be in blackface, visceral evidence of the racist stereotyping that permeates American culture. Performers in blackface were regular fixtures of theater, circus, and vaudeville productions throughout the 19th century and well into the 20th century. These routines relied on comedy, derision, and distortion to normalize negative perceptions of African Americans, assert white superiority among performers and viewers, and perpetuate inequality.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16649/at-the-hippodrome

Bearing the burden of a large basket and with her hands firmly on her hips, she is every bit the strong fisherwoman, the artist’s most frequent subject during his English sojourn of 1881-82. Homer positions the viewer slightly below Storey, giving her an even nobler, more monumental presence. The greater solidity and refinement of Homer’s figure drawing style was due at least in part to his study of Old Master drawings at the British Museum.This drawing demonstrates a shift in the way that Homer used opaque white watercolor. No longer reserving it for discrete highlights, he adopted the English practice of diluting opaque white watercolor to portray mist, clouds, and the “effects of distance and atmosphere” (Cohn 1977, p. 51). The artist applied this media in broad, expressive strokes, ending them in curves to indicate wispy clouds and varying the opacity to suggest different densities. He employed a dilute wash in the lower portion of the sky, dragging the side of his brush to create a hard edge that defined the horizon.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16791/flamborough-head-england

An early painting by Motherwell, Wall Painting with Stripes fuses the geometric rigor found in the art of Henri Matisse, Piet Mondrian, and Pablo Picasso with an organic or biomorphic abstract language that is reminiscent of the imagery employed by Surrealists Max Ernst and Joan Miró. Although signed and dated 1944, this painting shows signs of having been altered over time by the artist. Pentimenti (evidence of previous compositions), including a complex network of lines that were simplified into egg-shaped forms and bulging curves, are visible underneath the vertical bands of ocher and white paint. Motherwell once wrote, “My pictures have layers of mistakes buried in them—an X-ray would disclose crimes—layers of consciousness, of willing.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/146986/wall-painting-with-stripes

In response to Baldwin’s experience as an African American living in a remote village in Switzerland, Ligon commented, “The gravity and weight and panoramic nature of that work inspired me … and the addition of the coal dust seemed to me to do that because it literally bulked up the text.” Allowing the words to degrade as part of his process, Ligon incorporated Baldwin’s meditations on colonialism, race, and national identity while addressing language’s inability to fully articulate experience.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/152428/stranger-in-the-village-13

usa_839,Joseph Cornell,Box construction,Untitled (Blue Sand Box),"This box is, like others of its type, designed to be handled; the sand, the metal ring, and the ball scattering into different formations like iron filings or a kaleidoscope. The inside of the box is painted white on all sides; a fine network of cracks suggests that it was artificially aged. As noted in the above media description, sixteen faint lines are etched into the bottom (or rear wall) of the box, radiating from a common center, and resulting in raised lines of white paint on either side of the incisions. An oval form was etched, using the same technique, in the upper right corner. The blue sand forms patterns when shaken that are determined by the raised lines. The three different mobile elements—ring, ball, and sand—make very different sounds as the box is shaken.Cornell mentioned “sand boxes” as early as 1945 in his diary jottings. Significantly, in an entry of October 8, 1945, he referred to two different kinds of objects that are possible sources for these boxes: the “sailor’s box” and the “sand box as discovered in shop—birdhouse that might have [been] tended by her hands” (Cornell 1993, pp. 125–26). It is not entirely evident what he meant by the latter, but the link with the “birdhouse” suggests the sand tray that is customarily placed on the bottom of a bird‘s cage. The sailor’s box was an object of deep resonance for Cornell, with its references to voyages, exotic birds and butterflies, navigation, and treasured keepsakes in general. In a diary note of April 4, 1943, Cornell described an “Exhibition of miscellaneous objects found in trunks of sailors… shells, toy snake, wales [sic] tooth, beads (exotic), a butterfly box” (Cornell Papers, AAA, reel 1058; originally cited in New York 1980–82, pp. 33–34). The Sand Boxes are perhaps like some such treasure salvaged from the bottom of the sea.— Entry, Dawn Ades, Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1997, p. 78-79.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/99781/untitled-blue-sand-box

usa_842,Andy Warhol,Color screenprint on cream card,Marilyn Monroe (Marilyn),"Due in part to his experience as a highly successful commercial illustrator in the 1950s, Andy Warhol was as much businessman as artist and understood the value of mass production and distribution. By the early 1960s, screenprinting had become the favored medium for commercial printing jobs, such as labels and signage. It was used to quickly reproduce photographic images on almost any flat surface. By 1962 Warhol had begun using it to put repeated images on his canvases—images that he had previously painted painstakingly by hand. Because Warhol had not finessed the process, his printing “mistakes” became a signature. In 1967 he began publishing limited-edition print portfolios in his studio under the aegis of Factory Editions.Marilyn was the first such portfolio, consisting of ten images made from the same 1953 publicity photograph of Marilyn Monroe in the film Niagara, which Warhol transformed with intentionally off-register printing and garish combinations of psychedelic colors. Daylight fluorescent colors, better known as Day-Glo colors, were invented in the 1930s, and by the 1960s had become integral to the graphic vocabulary of Pop art. While a conventional bright color reflects 80 to 90 percent of its color, a Day-Glo color appears to reflect more than 300 percent of its color. It is no wonder then that art historian Robert Rosenblum observed that Marilyn’s face “seems perpetually illuminated by the afterimage of a flashbulb.” With this method and presentation, Warhol and his work became synonymous with Pop Art.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/150045/marilyn-monroe-marilyn

usa_848,David Wojnarowicz,Spray paint and acrylic on board,Queer Basher/Icarus Falling,"David Wojnarowicz was identified by The New York Times critic, Michael Kimmelman, in 1992 as “one of the most influential artists of the 1980s.” Wojnarowicz first emerged in the context of the brash and brief burst of energy that took place in New York’s East Village in the beginning of the 1980s. Fusing the aesthetics of the punk-music scene, a keen awareness of an ethnically diverse street culture, and a committed sense of political activism, Wojnarowicz’s earliest works were often informal and ephemeral. The 1980s East Village scene in which Wojnarowicz thrived produced a number of artists who went on to broader recognition, including Keith Haring, Kenny Scharf, Jenny Holzer, and Jean-Michel Basquiat. His paintings, photographs, installations, performances, and experimental films are distinguished by raw expressions of rage and personal longing. Wojnarowicz’s work, most often concerned with the inequities and disenfranchisement of living with HIV and AIDS, ranged from the intentionally shrill to the elegiac. A gifted writer, the poignant beauty of his vision is perhaps best glimpsed through his published journal excerpts, short stories, and autobiographical essays. Indeed, the artist is now widely recognized for the strength of his artistic expression both in the visual arts and with the written word.

In many of her works, she presents small moments of human drama that function as portraits of individual personalities, passions, and obsessions. The artist has stated, “I am trying to gather a complete series of human feelings, even if reflected in more than one person. The same room is the setting for eroticism, rage, pensiveness, creativity, repulsion, anxiety, joy, anguish, pleasure. It is as if I wanted to explain the entire range of the emotional or existential world.” The workings of emotion are far from simple, though, and as Taylor-Wood depicts ritualized expressions and intense outbursts in works like Hysteria, she explores the possible disjunctions between outward behavior and an internal sense of self.The title Hysteria refers to an extreme state of emotional disturbance while recalling the now-discredited notion of female hysteria, a common diagnosis during the Victorian era for women experiencing any number of symptoms. The eight-minute video is a closely framed view of a woman’s face that challenges us to distinguish whether she is laughing or crying. The footage is presented in slow motion and without sound, heightening the confusion between these different emotions. In narrative cinema, close-ups conventionally elicit a feeling of intimacy with the characters, but Taylor-Wood’s ambiguous depiction of the woman’s silenced cries encourages varied responses—from conflicting senses of identification and alienation to different shades of emotional engagement and critical detachment.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/184192/hysteria

The tree’s roots are expressive formal elements in their own right, but these ancient tentacles also seem to protect the resting man. Like many of Homer’s Adirondacks watercolors, Campfire, Adirondacks was conceived on the spot, with washes laid in to suggest areas of light and shadow, but the artist probably finished the work back in his studio in Maine or at the North Woods Club. Conveying a convincing sense of immediacy and spontaneity, Homer’s watercolors were often the result of deliberate planning and several campaigns of painting. Sometimes ephemeral effects were difficult to recapture in the studio, as in the smoke of the campfire where color was applied and blotted repeatedly.Visual evidence indicates that Homer used resist to define the crooked tree trunks on the lefthand side of the composition. Without this tool, it would have been impossible to achieve the intricate contours of the trunks while simultaneously applying an even wash to the surroundings. Over a preliminary gray wash, Homer, following his graphite underdrawing, would have brushed on the resist in the shape of the tree trunks. Even before it dried, it would form a strong, cohesive film on the paper’s surface without soaking into the fibers; because oil repels water, it would have remained undisturbed while Homer brushed dark-blue wash across it and the neighboring area. Once the wash dried, he would have scrubbed off the resist with a dull scraper or stiff brush and a solvent such as turpentine. Homer’s vigorous cleaning may have broken up the resist, scattering tiny fragments that became lodged in slow-drying, dense, or gum-rich passages of watercolor elsewhere on the sheet. When he was finished, the forms of the trunks were visible against the blue background.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16782/campfire-adirondacks

(That same year, the Hugo Gallery in New York put on a joint exhibition of Cornell’s work on the Romantic Ballet and of Petit’s ballet productions under the title La Lanterne magique du ballet romantique of Joseph Cornell/Decors for Ballets Choreographed by Roland Petit.) Jeanmaire’s flamboyant performances in Carmen “set a high-water mark in the projection of unabashed sexuality in ballet” (New York, Castelli, Feigen, Corcoran, Joseph Cornell and the Ballet, 1983, exh. cat. by Sandra Leonard Starr, p. 74). Cornell’s diary entries record his passionate involvement in a friendship that was, in fact, one-sided, for Jeanmaire barely recalled him (ibid.). In November of 1949, he noted in his diary “grat [itude]. for Zizi different mood from orig. intensity. Less obsession” (ibid., p. 75), and in the same month had a fantasy about her one night while passing the Winter Garden Theater where she was dancing (ibid., p. 7.5 n. 9). It was, however, as the Princess Aurora in La Belle au bois dormant (Sleeping Beauty), the epitome of the Romantic Ballet, that he chose to depict her, rather than as the fiery Carmen.Cornell’s use of artificial light, with which he also experimented in some of his bird boxes (see, for example, Untitled (Lighted Bird)), is particularly effective here; the dancer is caught in the spotlight, as if on stage, and the specks of glass and glitter flash in the dim blue light like a sequined costume. As so often in Cornell’s works, the division between the natural and the artificial is erased here, conferring an uncanny character to the scene. The dancer is surrounded not by obvious stage scenery or curtains, but by a large chunk of real tree bark. The viewer has the momentary feeling of looking out from a hole in a tree trunk, like one of Cornell’s owls, onto this moonlit star.— Entry, Dawn Ades, Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1997, p. 60.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/99762/untitled-lighted-dancer

usa_870,Joseph Cornell,Box construction,Untitled (Bird),"This box is deceptively simple, with its apparently rudimentary materials and construction. The wood cutout of a bird, unusually, does not have a colored print pasted onto it. It is constructed of natural raw wood, partially stained with a chalklike substance, similar to the interior walls of the box. The liming of the wood makes it resemble driftwood; within the Surrealist context, its heavily grained effect also recalls the long history of experiments with frottage and grattage by artists such as Max Ernst.There is, however, a strict geometry to this box, to which even the toylike accoutrements scattered on the floor confirm. Square or rectangular forms dominate, though there are also circles (wood disk, ball, cork). The bird looks toward a wad of paper squares, probably already darkened with age and acidity when the box was constructed, nailed to the wall at left. The effect is of a tear-off wall calendar, or spiked receipts, or even old-fashioned toilet paper.The key detail is the pair of arrows behind the bird’s perch, cut from very thin pieces of wood. Formally, the arrows echo the two dowels, which can move freely on the floor of the box like the disk and ball. The proximity of the arrows to the bird‘s breast suggests a variation on the theme of the bird as victim or target (see, for instance, Habitat Group for a Shooting Gallery, 1943, Des Moines Art Center; New York 1980 –82, pl. XXIII); the relatively plain form of the bird and its whitish color also recall the white dove of peace. Symbolically, the arrows are richly associative. They recall the arrows on sign posts, as well as the black arrows in Giorgio de Chirico’s “playthings” paintings, like The Evil Genius of a King (1914; New York, The Museum of Modern Art; Maurizio Fagiolo dell’ Arco, L’opera completa di De Chrico, 1908-1924, Mil an, 1984, no. 68, ill.) or The Feast Day (1914, Chicago, Neumann collection; ibid., no. 67, ill.). But the conjunction of the arrows with the bird has an even stronger association with the national emblem of the American bald eagle, perched on olive branches and arrows. The effect is somewhat ambiguous: the box could be a simple, folksy version of the American emblem or it could be a critical comment on the immediate postwar era in the United States, with its witch hunts of those involved in so-called un-American activities.— Entry, Dawn Ades, Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1997, p.52.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/99788/untitled-bird
usa_871,William Merritt Chase,Oil on canvas,North River Shad,"William Merritt Chase painted numerous versions of fish still lifes, many of which were quickly purchased by museums across the country. Because of the popularity of these works, the artist worried that he would be remembered only “as a painter of fish.” Chase’s training in the Munich style, characterized by scintillating surface texture and careful brushwork, is showcased in North River Shad. Brilliant white strokes form the fish’s iridescent scales, accentuating the weight and density of the voluminous creature at center. The painting is a striking departure from his better-known Impressionist renderings of city parks and other outdoor scenes.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/69774/north-river-shad
usa_872,Richard Serra,Lead,Close Pin Prop,"In the late 1960s, Richard Serra pioneered “antiform,” an approach to sculpture that challenged the reductive formalism of Minimalism by focusing on the process or act of creation. Capturing the raw, muscular energy of working with lead and steel, the artist utilized these materials to explore fundamental properties of sculptural tension. In 1968 Serra created his first “props,” consisting of plates and tubes in precarious configurations. Although these works are entirely stable, as all are carefully balanced, they employ gravity as their fundamental support and thus have an unnerving quality. The result is an aggressive sculptural experience evoking potential danger. The title refers to the artist Chuck Close, who visited Serra’s studio when this prop was being made.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/111638/close-pin-prop

usa_876,Joseph Cornell,Box construction with painted glass,Untitled (Black Hunter),"The secretive character of this box and its kinetic elements render it particularly resistant to reproduction. Cornell chose four photographic images of a man shooting a gun, presumably taken in quick sequence, as in early photographic experiments in investigating motion, which he photostated and arranged vertically. They are slightly tilted into an arc, with the size of the image reduced toward the top, giving an impression of recession.The movement within this box is clearly related to film. Cornell wrote two movie scenarios, one of which, Monsieur Phot (1933), was published in Julien Levy’s Surrealism (New York, 1936, pp. 77–88). Monsieur Phot shows a sophisticated sense of film’s potential for transforming its material and creating a kind of technical fantasy through such devices as montage and dissolve. Its atmosphere is an ambiguous mixture of slapstick and dream, characteristic of such Surrealist films as Un Chien Andalou by Salvador Dalí and Luis Bunuel (1929). The scenes shift swiftly; Diane Waldman summarized one sequence, in which the reflection of chandeliers in a mirror“becomes the chandeliers, in the interior of a ‘large, sumptuous glass and china establishment’ … through which a pheasant of gorgeous plumage flies as if through the ‘branches of his native wood.’ Suddenly, in a dream scene of considerable symbolic significance, revolver shots ring out, shattering the glass into a million crystal fragments … The suggestions of action, especially the sequences involving the pheasant and revolver shots, coalesce in a concentration of 1939, Black Hunter, one of Cornell’s earliest experiments with movement” (Waldman 1977, p. 18; quotations within quotation from Monsieur Phot, in Levy 1936, pp. 83–84).Both the scenario and the box itself echo Rene Clair’s Dada film Entr’acte of 1924, especially in the latter’s “hunting sequence,” where the target continually and magically changes. In its imagery of birds, balls, glass, and mirrors, Monsieur Phot also prefigured many of Cornell’s later themes and materials. The enclosed blackness or the box evokes the dark interior of the cinema, Cornell’s and the Surrealists’ favorite lieu d’enchantment (place of enchantment). The touches or brilliant red provide a theatrical and fittingly violent note.Julien Levy, who first met Cornell in November of 1931, when the artist brought a sheaf of his collages to Levy’s gallery, remembered suggesting on this occasion that Cornell might“try working in the round? Maybe add some motion, some mobility? Look. Here’s a photograph of a man with a gun.’ I pointed to one of the sepia prints on the wall behind me. ‘and here’s a partridge. One could paste them at two ends of a shadow box. Build a little sloping alley and let a bullet, or a ball bearing roll between them.’ I glanced at him, but you would never know from his expression whether he was considering or resenting another’s idea (Julien Levy, Memoirs of an Art Gallery, New York, 1977, p.78).Whether or not Cornell took the idea of the box with movable parts at this moment from Levy is impossible to say; certainly Levy’s suggestion does seem to foreshadow the construction of this box.— Entry, Dawn Ades, Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1997, p. 36-37.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/99765/untitled-black-hunter

It was on one of his trips back to his native country that he created The Powerhouse, Falls Village, Connecticut. The artist frequently painted winter scenes; like many Impressionists, he was fascinated by the challenge of rendering snow and its many hues in sunlight and shade. While the winter setting was typical for Schofield, the industrial subject matter was not. In the early nineteenth century Falls Village had been a center for iron production, but by the time the artist painted these buildings, the industry was in a serious decline.

usa_881,George Segal,"Metal, plaster, glass, wood, plastic, 16mm color film, silent, transferred to digital video (projection), 2 min 54 sec loop",The Truck,"In the 1960s, when the Abstract Expressionist and Pop Art movements were trans-forming artists’ working methods, George Segal explored the long-established genre of figurative sculpture. He created life-size human figures using cloth strips dipped in wet plaster and displayed the rough, unpainted casts as his finished product. Segal often placed his sculptural forms within a larger tableau of commercially made objects in order to create active, eerily inhabited spaces.Purchased in 1966, The Truck was the Art Institute’s first acquisition to incorporate a moving-image element. The artist combined the front of a red Ford F-Series pickup; one of his signature cast-plaster figures as the driver; and the film Highway at Night (projected on the truck’s windshield, in a continuous loop) to create what is now commonly referred to as an environmental sculpture. While today’s audiences for contemporary art are used to having disparate visual elements presented to them in this way, Segal’s early work was truly groundbreaking.The same year The Truck was acquired, it won first prize in the museum’s Sixty-Eighth American Exhibition. This display, curator A. James Speyer explained in the catalogue, “shows the work of twenty artists, each with a kind of complete, individual exhibit rather than a single, specific painting or sculpture… . All these exhibits share a physical insistence and vital presence which assumes environmental stature.” An article on the show in Time captures both the novelty of The Truck in 1966 and something of what it is like to experience it even now:To bring off the joy ride, Segal had rigged a small film projector and mirror arrangement to the right of the cab, which beamed the movie onto the truck’s frosted windshield. Watching it, one housewife confided: ‘That’s the way my husband drives…’ Juror Martin Friedman, director of Minneapolis’ Walker Art Center, put it another way: ‘I found it very moving. Actually … by treating the man almost as a ghost, as a calcified figure, Segal presents you with reality, then questions the existence of reality.’”One of Segal’s most important early works, The Truck helped to change sculpture by encompassing its viewers—allowing them to share an experience over a period of time—and by blurring the once-steadfast boundaries between life and art.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/25674/the-truck

For the next three years, Wollaston worked in New York, executing numerous portraits for area sitters eager to acquire quality likenesses from a skilled, European-trained artist—a rarity in mid-18th-century America. Wollaston rendered his figures with convincing modeling and forms, excelling in the depiction of colorful draperies. In Portrait of a Woman, as in his other works of the time, the artist employed formulaic poses, gestures, and dress, a result, in part, of looking to English sources for portraiture, but also a means of meeting the many requests for commissions. Beginning in 1753, Wollaston painted in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and South Carolina.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/79765/portrait-of-a-woman

Prout’s Neck, Breakers, later the model for the monumental oil painting Early Morning after a Storm at Sea, shows the artist’s continued fascination with the power of the sea. However, unlike his earlier marine works, this and other watercolors made at Prout’s Neck are usually devoid of human activity, exploring nature’s grandeur in its many manifestations. This work also exemplifies important aspects of Homer’s technique as a watercolorist, including the way he layered strokes of color—using a range of light and dark blues—to create the depth and force of the breaking waves. He used the white of the paper to produce a brilliant sheen on the sea, juxtaposed with a hazy sky above.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16815/prout-s-neck-breakers
usa_885,Joseph Cornell,Box construction,Untitled (For Tamara Toumanova),"Like Hommage à Tamara Toumanova, this box (also known as Feathered Swan) was made for the ballerina Tamara Toumanova. Cornell saw Toumanova perform Swan Lake in 1941, and he subsequently often associated her with this role. The swan here evidently suggests her presence, floating as it does above feathers that more vividly evoke the dancer’s costume than the bird itself. Cornell did on occasion incorporate actual fragments of the dancer’s costume in his tributes to Toumanova. On the back of one of these, Swan Lake for Tamam Toumanova (1946, Houston, Menil Foundation), Cornell wrote, “An actual wisp or two of a white feather from a head piece worn by Toumanova in Swan Lake mingles with the larger ones bordering the box” (Christine Hennessey, “ Joseph Cornell : A Balletomane,” Archives of American Art Journal 23, 3 [1983], p. 11 and fig. 2). The white paper cutout swan covered with white feathers, like the swan in Cygnecre pusculaire, recalls Cornell’s miniature paper cutouts of scenes from Hans Christian Andersen.— Entry, Dawn Ades, Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1997, p. 42.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/99784/untitled-for-tamara-toumanova

One of these works was incorporated as a picture within a picture in Human Figure with Two Birds, a painting that set the stage for an extraordinary series of works that Ernst began in 1930, which featured a large, fantastic bird figure that the artist identified as Loplop. In these works, Loplop, the artist’s “private phantom attached to my person,” generally holds up a picture for presentation.

Pictured under stormy skies, and with his daughter Biddy sitting by herself on a low stone fence, the dilapidated scene projects an air of melancholy. Although Brook later referred to the canvas as a “portrait” of a house, the title, Twentieth Century Ruin, frames the work in a different light.

usa_892,Joseph Cornell,box construction with amber glass,Untitled (Sequestered Bower),"The title Sequestered Bower commonly attributed to this work seems to derive from Cornell’s humorous description of one of his Owl Boxes, in a diary note of July 10, 1948, as “Large SEQUESTERED BOWER “ (Cornell Papers, AAA, reel 1058; cited in Dawn Ades, “The Transcendental Surrealism of Joseph Cornell,” in New York 1980–82, p. 41). The “habitat” of bark and dried moss further links this box to Cornell‘s Owl Boxes (Untitled (Large Owl)and Untitled (Lighted Owl)) and suggests that it was made during the same period. The substitution of a blonde, naked, female plastic doll with painted red lips for the owl, whose habitat she occupies, is startling. The box is disturbing on several levels. The contrast between the owl in its natural habitat and the doll/woman, whose appearance is as emphatically artificial as her setting is unnatural, produces an unusually jarring effect. Is she to be understood as displacing the owl or as being herself trapped or displaced? The ambiguity of the figure—child‘s toy but also child-woman – is underlined by the mirrors hidden inside the bark and placed at an angle on either side of her, which allow her to be viewed from the side. This mode of presentation is redolent of a strip club rather than of the vanitas or memento mori theme, which often included a mirror and was linked to the Owl Boxes. The idea of the femme-enfant hints at a premature sexuality which inevitably suggests a connection with Hans Bellmer and Balthus. Cornell would certainly have been aware of Bellmer’s articulated Poupee; photographs of the doll had earlier been reproduced in the French Surrealist journal Minotaure (see Hans Bellmer, “Poupee: Variations sur Ie montage d’une mineure articulee,” Minotaure 6 [Winter 1934–35], pp. 30-31; Bellmer’s Jointure de boules in Minotaure 8 [1936], p. 9; and an untitled photograph by Bellmer of the Poupee, de fenceless, in a wooded environment, which was published adjacent to Cornell ‘s Glass Bell, in Minotaure 10 (1937, p. 34).However, rather than emulate Bellmer’s violent dismantling of the female doll‘s body, Cornell left his doll intact. There is just a suspicion here that Cornell is making a faintly ironic protest at Bellmer’s over-explicit and aggressive works; he was uneasy with the “darker” side of Surrealism, which he saw in the work of Max Ernst and surely in Ballmer. The manicured primness of this doll, with its overlarge head, in its grim setting, provides such a strong contrast to Bellmer’s Poupee that it is hard not to find humor in it.Cornell made two other boxes that offer close comparisons with this one, both of them now in The Museum of Modern Art, New York: Untitled (Bebi Marie), a larger box of the early 1940s containing a dressed doll immured in an undergrowth of frosted twigs; and Untitled (Melisande) of 1948/50, in which a naked doll appears through a small square opening in a box surrounded by moss or bark, as if buried alive (New York 1980–82, pl. VIII and no. 167, ill., respectively). Cornell supposedly took the doll in Untitled (Bebe: Marie) surreptitiously from his sister Betty (Elizabeth Cornell Benton). These boxes share the disturbing aspect of Untitled (Sequestered Bower, but not the further dimension of humor.Although immured in a forest enclave, the doll in the Bergman box seems an unlikely Rapunzel or Sleeping Beauty. It should be noted, however, that she is the type of doll whose eyes close when she is tilted back ward, and unlikely as it may seem, given the fragility of the other materials in the box, this raises the possibility that this box, too, is a kind of toy: a Sleeping Beauty toy.— Entry, Dawn Ades, Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1997, p.55-56.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/99783/untitled-sequestered-bower

Here dabs of diluted pink, red, and yellow suggest the movement of clouds, figures, and wind. Marin painted the sky with long, dry brushstrokes, then defined the clouds, working wet-into-wet by dripping in dilute washes of color that dispersed the pigment and yielded dark, feathered lines. After the washes dried, he punctuated the remaining white of the sky with yellow marks to add brightness. Demonstrating an intuitive understanding of how watercolor behaves, as well as a willingness to experiment with unpredictable results, Marin found such manipulations liberating. This was among the 25 watercolors shown at Stieglitz’s 291 in the spring of 1909, the first time the gallery owner exhibited Marin’s work.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/2915/mills-and-footbridge-meaux
usa_900,Joseph Cornell,Box construction,Untitled (Hôtel de l’Etoile),"This was one of the first boxes Edwin Bergman acquired directly from Cornell. Following Bergman’s first visit to the artist‘s home in mid-September 1959, Cornell wrote about the travel arrangements for the box in a letter: “I wanted to see the “Night Sky” box under way before I wrote to thank you for your courtesy in bringing me the fairy tokens from the Dorazios. As to the former it got under way on Friday via Railway Express and I believe that it will arrive in the same condition as you saw it. I have kept a tracing of the inner spattered “pane” in case of breakage, and so will you kindly advise if such it might require?” (Joseph Cornell, unpublished letter to Edwin Bergman of September 20, 1959). This letter is revealing of the artist’s attitude to replacement parts for his boxes and to his titles, which he used in a generic, descriptive way, rather than as precise labels.A large vertical opening is cut into the box’s rear wall to reveal the interior of a smaller box. A pane of clear glass is placed behind the opening, through which a panel covering the rear wall of the smaller box is visible. This panel, which may well be of glass (thus explaining Cornell’s reference in the above letter to an “inner spattered ‘pane’”), is painted dark blue and spattered with white paint to resemble a constellation. As Cornell’s letter to Bergman indicates, this apparently random splatter was carefully recorded in case the box was broken.Cornell’s interest in both the scientific and imaginative aspects of the study of the stars is well documented. Here, there is a perfect balance between the three main elements of the image: the title, which introduces the multiple associations with glamour and travel of the word “star”; the “abstract” pattern of a constellation formed by the spattered paint, which resembles scientific photographs of the night sky, taken with the assistance of telescopes; and the figurative representation of the myth of Auriga, after which the constellation is named. The image of Auriga Cornell used in this box derives from Johannes Hevelius’s star atlas, Uranographia totum coelum stellatum, published in 1690 (see Giuseppe Maria Sesti, The Glorious Constellations: History and Mythology, New York, 1991, p. 256, ill.). In a diary entry of July 15, 1941, the artist described his first visit to the Hayden Planetarium in New York: “another moving experience, especially on the second floor with its blue dome, silhouetted city sky-line fringing it, and the gradual appearance of all the stars in the night sky to music. … The astronomical paraphernalia: charts, transparencies, broken meteors, and especially compass curios (also armillaries, telescopes, etc.) are intriguing. … On the main floor a particularly fine set of murals of the zodiac, picked out in white on blue. The nicest rendition of the Gemini I’ve seen.” (Cornell 1993, p. 96). Cornell was subsequently a frequent visitor to the Planetarium, subscribing to its periodical, Sky Reporter; and becoming an expert on stars.At the Stable Gallery, in December of 1955, Cornell exhibited a group of works under the general title of Winter Night Skies, giving them the names of the constellations Auriga, Andromeda, and Camelopardalis. Three versions of Auriga were shown, of which this box was very likely one. A short preface by Garrett P. Serviss in the exhibition announcement merits being quoted in full for its insight into Cornell’s interest in astronomy: “The mythology of Auriga is not clear, but the ancients seem to have been of one mind in regarding the constellations as representing the figure of a man carrying a goat and her two kids in his arms. Auriga was also looked upon as a beneficent constellation, and the goat kids were believed to be on the watch to rescue shipwrecked sailors. As Capella, which represents the fabled goat, shines nearly overhead in winter; and would ordinarily be the first bright star to beam down through the breaking clouds of a storm at that season, it is not difficult to imagine how it got its reputation as the seaman’s friend. Auriga as a constellation, was in vented long before the time of the Greeks, and was intended prophetically to represent that Good Shepherd who was to come and rescue the sinful world.”This romantic and Christian interpretation of the myth of Auriga is strikingly different from the one given by Catherine Tennant. She emphasized a different stage of the myth: that Auriga was Erecthonious, future king of Athens, deformed son of Earth and Vulcan, who was placed in a box by Athena and given to the care of two maidens, who opened the box and “when they saw the child inside, entwined by a serpent … fled in terror and fell to their death from the Acropolis” (Box of Stars, London, 1993, p. 27). Characteristically, Cornell focused on the beneficent rather than the malevolent aspects of the myth.The words Hotel de l’Etoile, which Cornell incorporated into this box, point directly to stargazing. Moreover, these words are thought to refer to the ballet Le Rendez-vous, whose set design by Brassaï included huge photographic enlargements of hotel logos (see Sandra Leonard Starr, in New York, Castelli, Feigen, Corcoran, Joseph Cornell and the Ballet, 1983, exh. cat., p. 75). Cornell frequently merged notions of theatrical or cinematic and astronomical stargazing.The trail of spattered paint, intended to evoke a constellation of stars, is also interesting in relation to the new painting practices in New York at the time, which were in turn influenced by Surrealist automatism. Both Max Ernst and Jackson Pollock had experimented with paint-dripping in their work. It is thus possible, given the profusion of both veiled and explicit references to other artists in Cornell‘s work, that the white trail of paint refers to this new development as well, and reflects the artist’s capacity to internalize and play with aspects of abstraction that otherwise seem alien to his art.— Entry, Dawn Ades, Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1997, p. 74-75.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/99777/untitled-hotel-de-l-etoile

This self-portrait, taken around 1917, presents the artist’s frank assessment of himself at a pivotal moment in his career. Distancing himself from the soft-focus sentimentality of the Photo-Secession, Steichen broke with his mentor, Alfred Stieglitz (who had earlier abandoned that group), and stopped painting. Responding in 1915 to a questionnaire from Stieglitz, Steichen declared his wish that photography galleries like Stieglitz’s remain receptive to new elements, such as the crisp and straightforward aesthetic advanced in this self-portrait.Edward Steichen was an early champion of Pictorialism, which promoted photography as a fine art; a painter as well as a photographer, he photographed himself in 1902 in soft focus, holding an artist’s brush and palette, and produced the image as a handmade gum print. Fifteen years later, his style and intentions had changed. This self-portrait, made on the eve of Steichen’s participation in World War I, shows the artist in sharp clarity with his studio camera, assessing himself frankly and cementing his new identity as strictly a photographer. He served as the commander of the photographic division for the United States Army Expeditionary Forces Air Service, documenting terrain in preparation for bombing sorties (a position to which he returned during World War II). Steichen worked in the 1920s and 1930s in magazines and advertising, before becoming curator of photography at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.For more on Edward Steichen’s work in the Art Institute’s collection visit the website: Edward Steichen’s World War I Years.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/193403/self-portrait-with-camera

In the year this Chicago picture was taken, Addams published Twenty Years at Hull House, referring to the settlement home for immigrants that she had founded in the city with Ellen Gates Starr:The Settlement is an attempt to relieve the overac-cumulation at one end of society and the destitution at the other. It must have a deep and abiding sense of tolerance. It must be hospitable and ready for experiment.

usa_930,Duane Stephen Michals,Gelatin silver print,Death Comes to an Old Lady,"Duane Michals initially turned to photography beginning in the late 1950s, following a brief career as a graphic designer. A decade later he began creating narrative sequences that play on themes such as desire, memory, dreams, and mortality. Composed of a succession of events, these staged scenes utilize cinematic language, but ultimately refer to specifically photographic tools. Whereas film stills depict single moments in time, many of Michals’s images show blurred figures, implying movement within each “frame.” Unlike the narrative sequence of a film, these images are open to individual interpretation and yield no overarching storyline. For this sequence, Michals enlisted his grandmother to animate his fascination with mortality, noting, “I am compulsive in my preoccupation with death. In some way, I am preparing myself for my own death.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/121129/death-comes-to-an-old-lady

Augustus Saint-Gaudens first created this portrayal of Deacon Samuel Chapin, a 17th-century leader in Springfield, Massachusetts, as a large-scale monument. The work was unveiled on Thanksgiving Day 1887, underlining the importance of settler origin stories for some members of the local community. Smaller reproductions like this one proved immensely popular at the turn of the 20th century, demonstrating the expansive and enduring reach of such mythmaking.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/191185/the-puritan
usa_932,Milton Avery,Oil on canvas,Conversation in Studio,"Milton Avery was an American artist known for his study and usage of color, often referred to as a precursor to Color Field painters. His work frequently bridged the gap between realist and abstract art. The four figures in Conversation in the Studio have not been identified; however, meetings like these were a common occurrence in both Avery’s New York apartment and art studio. American artists such as Mark Rothko and Adolph Gottlieb among others would often stop by to see and discuss Avery’s work, while Avery in turn would sketch the gatherings and conversations taking place around him. The artist himself addressed this tendency, asking “why talk when you can paint?” The flat color fields and textured application of thin paint layers give shape and structure to the elegantly dressed figures and their surroundings. By the 1940s, Avery was increasingly using a nonnaturalistic palette to create mood in his paintings, as the bright-blue and green faces of the men demonstrate.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/208319/conversation-in-studio

Homer understood and fostered this conception of childhood; small groups of children in rural settings dominate his work of the early 1870s. The graphite study Children Sitting on a Fence, on which the watercolor Children on a Fence (1874) is based, shows how Homer used monochrome drawings to study figure relationships and to map out the primary patterns of light and shadow. Although the small figure group of children poised on the upper rail of a fence remains essentially the same between the drawing and the watercolor, the white highlights on the children’s hats and bodies in the drawing differ from the highlights Homer employed in the watercolor, suggesting that his treatment of light was sometimes improvised away from the scene. His preparatory drawings served as guides but did not prevent experimentation in the studio.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/45349/children-sitting-on-a-fence

Hills of Byram was executed in March 1909 in Point Pleasant, overlooking the river and the distant quarry on the border of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Bare trees, dead grasses, and the pale sky evoke a crisp spring day, freely painted with a flickering yet controlled touch. Although Garber’s painting appears impressionistic, he prized form and structure, and carefully planned his compositions.

A pioneering figure in California Light and Space art, Irwin had launched a series of luminous disk paintings one decade prior: Untitled comprises a single, spray-painted, convex plastic disk, cantilevered 12 inches from the wall. Four lights are angled toward the disk to produce a diaphanous array of overlapping shadows. These seem to merge with the painting’s radiant core, blurring the distinction between what is material and what is immaterial. On the one hand, Irwin’s work is elusive and illusory. On the other hand, the artist’s explorations of perceptual phenomena led him to conclude that “all ideas and values have their roots in experience,” which is always, importantly, “conditional.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/31595/untitled

usa_950,Doug Aitken,"Eleven–channel digital video, sound (projected on plasma screens with mirrors); 6:30 min. loop Edition number one of four",the moment,"Doug Aitken’s acclaimed video installations take aim at what it means to live in an age when human experience is increasingly shaped by the mediating effects of technology and an unprecedented degree of mobility. Many of his videos unfold as journeys through desolate places in which the natural and the artificial begin to blend. Others offer technology-inflected visions of landscapes in a state of flux. Aitken described his body of work as a series of “structures which move outward in different trajectories and yet share a connection.” He went on to say, “If I create a work which is intensely human, then maybe the next work I want to make is as far from that as possible. It is a constantly evolving process of point and counterpoint.” The three works by Aitken in the Art Institute’s collection—monsoon, thaw, and the moment—vary in their formal qualities and subject matter, but they all pursue similar themes. Additionally, they provide a sense of how Aitken has used the spatial configurations of his multichannel installations in increasingly ambitious ways to extend his films’ narratives beyond the edges of the screen.If Aitken’s projects often describe how technology shapes our relation to place and our ways of being in the world, in a more abstract manner the artist explores how technology and motion can inform our notions of space and time. In a brief but prescient passage in a 1950 essay, the philosopher Martin Heidegger described how developments in the technology of media (film, radio, and television) and transportation (the railroad and the automobile) gave rise to a condition of uniform “distancelessness” in which “everything is equally far and equally near.” Aitken’s art seems to focus on these cultural conditions in an advanced state, more than forty years later. He has remarked, “On some level, all of my work is related to what I see as certain new tendencies in the culture … Accelerated nomadicism, self-contained, decentralized communication—these things are at the core of the space we’re living in, a terrain that is radically different from the past.”Of all his works, Aitken’s large-scale video installation the moment perhaps deals with these ideas most explicitly. The installation consists of eleven screens suspended from the ceiling in an S-pattern and, as the video begins, the darkened gallery resounds with a hushed whisper that declares “I want to be every place.” The piece then presents a tightly orchestrated sequence of views that show people waking up in hotel rooms or nondescript dwellings and moving out into largely deserted cities. As the fragmented narrative progresses, anonymous characters engage in similar sets of activities, which emphasizes a common state of being—an urge to get moving, to be everywhere—if also a degree of isolation.The configuration of the moment continues the themes of movement and unrest while providing a figurative parallel between human travels and the flow of images around and to us. The visitor to Aitken’s installation navigates a dark, wide-open gallery space to view the work, prompting a state of wandering that recalls that of the film’s subjects. Depending on where one stands, the visual relationship between the different screens changes, and each monitor has a mirror on its back, which expands the visual field dramatically and creates a kaleidoscopic flurry of imagery in certain viewing positions. At the same time, the channels are not static—the narrative threads do not play on set monitors but instead migrate across the eleven screens in different ways as the video progresses. For much of its duration, variations of similar scenes play across the screens simultaneously, enacted by different characters; occasionally, however, a single image aligns momentarily on all of them. Finally, the images are set into a frantic state of motion, jumping from one screen to the next in quick succession. The looped video builds to a rushing climax before starting over—the characters returning, if only temporarily, to a state of rest.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/187252/the-moment

usa_960,Joseph Cornell,Box construction with painted glass,Untitled (Hôtel du Nord),"This box shares motifs and clippings with several other boxes bearing the title Hotel du Nord (see, for example, Hotel du Nord, c. 1953, New York, Whitney Museum of American Art; Ashton 1974, p. 92, ill.). This was the name of a hotel in Copenhagen, in which the Danish writer Hans Christian Andersen, one of Cornell‘s favorite authors, often stayed; it was also the title of a 1938 film by Marcel Carne starring Arletty (pseud. for Leonie Bathiat). “From the moment she stood on the bridge over the Canal St.-Martin in the 1938… classic Hotel du Nord, Arletty entered film history,” reads her obituary; “her testy reply to her violent, wayward lover, ‘Atmosphere, atmosphere …’ indeed became one of the most memorable moments in French film” (“Obituaries,” New York Times, July 25,1992). This moment is one that could well have endeared the film to Cornell.The fact that the upper and lower edges of the rear wall, as well as the ceiling, are painted a deep blue, and the nature of the printed reproductions, hint at celestial or astronomical associations, which are more explicit in the box known as Hotel de l’Etoile. At the top left are three printed images of a boar, a ram, and a bear (the first concealed in this photograph by the white dowel in the foreground). Vertically, on the right, are a griffin, a horse, and a camel. All six of these animal images are reproductions of drawings in a late fourteenth century sketchbook (Oxford, Magdalene College; see Colin Eisler, Dürer”s Animals, Washington, D.C., 1991, p. 9, figs. 1.7–8). Cornell may have intended these animals to allude to constellations. They were no doubt just some of the many images of animals he collected from natural history albums, astronomical charts, and endpapers. Cornell wrote to Marianne Moore in a letter decorated with collaged etchings of animals, birds, and plants: “Could one call the spirit that animates the animals in the end-paper snips ‘gargoylesque lyricism‘?” (Cornell 1993, p. 123).The image of the boy is Albrecht Durer’s Self Portrait (1484, silverpoint, Vienna, Graphische Sammlung Albertina; see Walter L. Strauss, The Complete Drawings of Albrecht Durer, vol. 1, New York, 1974, pp. 4–5, ill.). Durer was an important figure to Cornell, both as artist and astronomer. According to Catherine Tennant, “It is to no less an artist than Durer, who published two star maps in the sixteenth century, which were copied in one form or another in all the star atlases which came after, that we owe the Western vision of the constellations” (Box of the Stars, London, 1993, p. 4).A French postage stamp of Jean Hey’s painting Suzanne de Bourbon in Prayer (1492/93, Paris, Musée du Louvre; see Philippe Lorentz and Annie Regond, Jean Hey: Le Maitre de Moulins, 1990, exh. cat., pp. 44–45, ill.) is pasted onto a cylindrical wood weight, suspended from a rod by a metal hook. The same image, enlarged, appears in the box Ann—in Memory.— Entry, Dawn Ades, Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1997, p.64-65.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/99776/untitled-hotel-du-nord

To communicate his excitement over the buildings, Marin aggressively blotted and reapplied color to build up tonal planes. Combining staccato marks to denote windows with soft, wet applications in the sky, he added long vertical stokes conveying the upward lift of the structures. Making the road in the foreground arc up as if the earth itself were heaving, he surrounded the dark blue patches and lines with slivers of bright white paper.

Here his subject allowed him to construct the ideal modernist painting by using overlapping planes that remain faithful to the canvas’s inherent flatness. However, the sample cards also connect his picture to everyday concerns. By titling his painting Spring, Demuth wryly highlighted the new reality of American life, in which the changing of seasons was heralded not by nature but by commerce.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/74375/spring

In 1995, Aitken traveled to Jonestown, Guyana, where almost twenty years earlier nearly one thousand members of the People’s Temple joined their leader, the Reverend Jim Jones, in a mass suicide. The artist had no other goal than to wait for a looming monsoon to break, and in the video the camera stands in as a patient witness, panning slowly across the ominously still landscape. Vibrantly colored views of the jungle, verging toward abstraction, are juxtaposed with vestiges of human presence, such as a barren road and an abandoned truck. The only sounds are a low drone and the occasional chirping of birds and crickets. The wind starts to blow heavily as night falls, but the rain never arrives. This potential moment of catharsis is deferred, and the viewer is left to contend with a sense of anticipation and absence, searching the landscape for telling traces of its past as the camera carries out its impassive surveillance.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/184178/monsoon

Nutt was a key member of the Hairy Who, a small group of Art Institute–trained artists who exhibited together at the Hyde Park Art Center in the mid- to late 1960s. He first painted on the back of Plexiglas—a material he became enamored with while playing pinball and observing painted ads in storefront windows. By the 1970s, he abandoned this painstaking process and began to work on canvas. Sally Slips Bye-Bye captures the spontaneous line, love of caricature, and high wit at the root of his practice. It also exemplifies a major body of work, in which Nutt expanded the narrative potential of his pictures by juxtaposing fragmented vignettes with a central, highly stylized figure.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/97401/sally-slips-bye-bye

Now Voyager was also the name of a 1941 novel by Olive Higgins Prouty and of a 1942 movie, based on the novel, starring Bette Davis. The title’s attraction for Cornell, given the voyage theme in so many of his works, is obvious. Here, though, the combination of title and image suggests a journey of a more interior kind, which is indeed evoked by Whitman‘s poem, and is a theme developed in both the novel and movie: these focus on the growth of the main protagonist, Charlotte Vale, from repressive childhood into mature adulthood. In Cornell‘s collage a child of uncertain gender is shown riding a merry-go-round horse, but the child’s distant gaze and the planets above hint at an imagined voyage of much grander dimensions.— Entry, Dawn Ades, Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1997, p. 91.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/99791/now-voyager

Completing these massive spectacles required a week or more of preparation. Mole and Thomas spent hours positioning the troops and constructed an enormous tower from which to photograph the arrangement. The “top” of these creations could be as far as a quarter mile from the camera, and the final composition only made sense from the camera’s pseudo-aerial point of view. To make The Human Liberty Bell, the photographers employed 25,000 military personnel at Camp Dix, New Jersey, a training ground for the 78th Division of the National Army.

usa_977,David Hockney,Color etching and aquatint from two copper plates on white wove paper,"The Old Guitarist, from The Blue Guitar","Since the early 1960s, David Hockney has sought ways to meld his modern aesthetic style with highly personalized subject matter. He started by inserting fragments of poems into his paintings, as, for example, in We Two Boys Together Clinging (1961), which integrates two lines from a Walt Whitman poem of the same title. Fifteen years later, inspired by Wallace Stevens’s “The Man with the Blue Guitar” (1937), with its themes of representation and imaginative transformation, Hockney made 10 drawings in colored inks and crayons. With the aid of master printer Aldo Crommelynck those drawings were converted into 20 mixed intaglio prints using a color-etching process initially developed for Pablo Picasso.While not a literal illustration of Stevens’s poem, the print series The Blue Guitar interprets its themes in visual terms, and most of the images show Hockney’s love of Picasso. The print Old Guitarist juxtaposes the Art Institute’s famous painting of 1903–04 (1926.253) with later Picasso iconography. Other sheets likewise contrast Picasso’s different phases within the same image; throughout the series, Hockney distinguishes the disparate styles by using different colors.It is perhaps Hockney’s Blue Guitar that has perpetuated the idea that Wallace Stevens was similarly inspired by Picasso’s Old Guitarist. Although Stevens was familiar with modern art and no doubt saw the painting when it was exhibited at the Wadsworth Atheneum in 1934, he insisted that no one picture inspired his famous poem.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/131299/the-old-guitarist-from-the-blue-guitar

usa_985,Richard Serra,Hot-rolled steel,Weights and Measures,"Capturing the raw, muscular energy required to work with lead and steel, Richard Serra began utilizing these materials in the late 1960s to explore the fundamental properties of sculptural tension. In 1968 he created his first “props,” consisting of plates and tubes, which fall into one of four categories—wall, corner, freestanding, or post-and-lintel. These sculptures entail a stable but unnerving performance of balance. A wall prop made of steel, Weights and Measures is not only visually striking but also physically imposing, experienced as much through the viewer’s sense of his or her own body as through vision. This work is a monumental form created from dense sheets that are not welded or joined; the result is a disquieting, even aggressive sculptural experience. Physical proximity and the sense of precariously balanced weight create a remarkably immediate relationship between space, object, and viewer.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/184102/weights-and-measures

A small pond behind his home offered ample artistic material, with its thick vegetation, water lilies, sun-dappled reflections, and shady nooks. A lifelong wildlife enthusiast, Benson excelled at depictions of birds. Here, he added a white heron to his composition, a species native to more southerly climes.

He began cutting and installing industrial felt in various configurations, ranging from rolled or tangled heaps on the floor to neatly folded geometric patterns hung on a wall.

This watercolor places the viewer on the rocky Maine shore among the scrub and juniper bushes, the latter rendered in fluid black strokes with an elegance of gesture comparable to Japanese calligraphy. Despite Homer’s stated antipathy to the straight horizon line, the artist’s 1894 group of reductive Prout’s Neck watercolors focuses on the horizon as a locus of beauty. Accordingly, Homer started work on Sunshine and Shadow by making a tick mark in pencil at the center of the paper. He created the effect of the sun by leaving the bare white of the paper for the brightest areas of illumination. In contrast, heavy, gray-blue clouds throw their shadows over large expanses of dark water. The artist appears to have laid down his washes quickly and fluidly. The effect is contemplative and uplifting, yet it hints at a darker side of nature.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16834/sunshine-and-shadow-prout-s-neck

Unite is a consummate example of the AfriCOBRA ethos because it embodies all of the group’s visual and theoretical ideals. It shows a group of Black Americans making the recognizable Black Power salute, thus communicating an expressive humanism while depicting a fight for cultural liberation. Layered on top of the strong verticals of the raised arms, the word UNITE appears repeatedly in striking block letters that fit together like syncopated pieces of a puzzle. The words alternate in both size and color, creating an effect of symmetry and luminosity.Many of the artists in AfriCOBRA had previously belonged to the Visual Workshop of OBAC (Organization of Black American Culture), which had created the Wall of Respect in Chicago in 1967. The AfriCOBRA group focused on creating a Black art movement that would positively impact the cultural lives of Black people around the world. They believed that the identity of the group was more important than that of the individual. Their work was specific and functional, and expressed statements about the artists’ existence as Black people, often integrating pointed text with their images.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/185757/unite-africobra

usa_1008,Joseph Cornell,Box construction,Untitled (Yellow Sand Fountain),"In a dairy entry of September 1945, Cornell wrote, “one of the finest boxes (objects) ever made was worked out this day (completed or almost). The box of a white chamber effect with a ‘fountain‘ of green sand running. Shell, broken stem glass for receptacle” (Cornell 1993, p. 124). The Sand Fountain Boxes are perhaps the most difficult of Cornell‘s works to appreciate in reproduction, for the pleasure of looking is ideally complemented by the pleasure of handling the boxes and watching the changes of shape in the pouring sand. In Untitled (Yellow Sand Fountain), when the box is turned upside down, the yellow sand collects within the hollow, triangular birdhouse. As the box is righted, it then pours from the entrance hole onto the broken glass, cascading from the glass’s irregular edges onto the floor of the box. This work thus combines the symbolic resonance of the hourglass, whose sands measure the passage of time, with the idle fascination of watching something (like waves) in unpredictable but repetitive motion. To paraphrase Marcel Duchamp, when asked about his Bicycle Wheel (1913, original lost; see Pontus Hulten, ed., Marcel Duchamp: Work and Life, Cambridge, Mass., 1993, p. 30, ill.), the movement provides a useful distraction, like watching a fire in a grate. The comparison with an hourglass is interesting from a formal point of view as well: in the latter the movement of the sand is regulated by passing through the instrument‘s narrow waist; here, the space between the upper and lower containers is open; the glass, rather than containing and enclosing the sand, allows it to spill out, its broken and irregular edge causing the sand to flow unequally.The broken glass is one of several signs of age and decay in the box, which underline the notion of time passing. The interior of the box is painted white and is intentionally aged, possibly by baking, a practice Cornell is known to have used. There are wide horizontal and vertical cracks in the paint on the rear wall, and feathered cracks on the birdhouse. White paint flakes are mingled with the yellow sand, and it is difficult to determine whether the effects of aging have been more dramatic than intended at the outset. As noted in the above media description, the edges of the glass front show traces of newsprint and adhesive residue. This effect is “matched” by the weathering on the wood frame.A blue stain on the interior side of the glass front, which looks like an accidental drip and has possibly faded over the years, contributes to the impression of the passage of time and its chance operations. The faint trace of a watery blue underlines the in version of the idea of “fountain,” which here literally “runs dry.” The apparently accidental character of this stain should not mislead one in to overlooking both the visual complement it provides to the yellow of the sand, and the powerful associations the color blue had for Cornell. The artist in fact identified this color with the azure of the heavens, which he linked with the poetry of Emily Dickinson and Stephane Mallarme. The latter’s poem L’Azur (The Blue) indeed opens with the line, “The serene irony of the eternal azure” (my translation; for the complete text of this poem, see Mallarme: The Poems, bilingual edition tr. with intro. by Keith Bosley, Middlesex, 1977, pp. 86–89).— Entry, Dawn Ades, Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1997, p. 80-81.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/99780/untitled-yellow-sand-fountain

These photographic pieces were ways to, literally, throw myself into my environment.” In both urban and natural landscapes, Acconci used a set of self-imposed instructions that described how to perform and document specific kinds of activities. In Estimations, his instructions and the results are listed along with the photographs. Here the artist explored the deceptive differences between reality, appearance, and representation.

usa_1021,Pierre Huyghe,"Vistavision film, sound, transferred to digital video (projection on screen); 7:51 min. loop Artist proof one of two, from an edition of five",Les Grands Ensembles (The Housing Projects),"Noted artist Pierre Huyghe uses diverse media—including large-scale installation, public events, and video—to delve into the uncertainties of representation and to investigate how narrative models affect our sense of reality. In the process, he moves through a variety of creative fields, such as architecture, cinema, design, and music, with an eye to their unique qualities and conventions. Although often grounded in particular historical or cultural reference points, his works unfold as open-ended entities that invite multiple interpretations.Huyghe’s video installation Les Grands Ensembles (The Housing Projects) presents a fixed view of two residential towers in a bleak urban landscape, swathed in fog at night. Lacking any signs of human activity, the buildings appear to take on lives of their own as the video’s buzzing electronic soundtrack, composed by Pan Sonic and Cédric Pigot, builds in intensity. Windows in the two facades begin to light up rhythmically and with increasing frequency, as if communicating in some sort of code. The towers, which are actually models the artist created in a film studio, echo French government housing projects common in the 1970s, but they do not represent specific buildings. Instead, they can be seen as archetypes, standing in for the Modernist program in architecture and the social agendas to which it was tied. Meanwhile, the audio track is reminiscent of experimental directions in electronic music in the same era, reinforcing this historical allusion. The video is a reflection on the failures of utopian Modernism, signaled in part by the desolate mise-en-scène. This familiar narrative, however, ultimately gives way to the volley of lights, a mysterious cipher that resists attempts at interpretation.A landmark project for Huyghe, Les Grands Ensembles premiered at the 2001 Venice Biennale as part of the artist’s installation of the French Pavilion. There it was accompanied by other works, such as Atari Light (1999), a room-sized version of the early video game Pong, which visitors could play on illuminated ceiling panels that evoked a Modernist grid. Huyghe installed the works in multiple rooms, separated by doors with modulating levels of transparency, to create what he described as “a blinking organism”—a constellation of associations and disjunctions that shifted as lines of sight opened up and disappeared.Interweaving themes from the histories of architecture, design, and popular culture, Huyghe invites viewers to consider our relationship with the overdetermined, highly coded world of mass-media representations. Les Grands Ensembles, for its part, introduces the artist’s engagement with forms of spectacle and the cultural conditions that emerge from them. The flashing lights that play across the facades of these buildings, repeated in an endless video loop, seem to ask whether this is a stream of coded information waiting to be translated or a deluge of vacant representation, a spectacle pointing to nothing but itself.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/184197/les-grands-ensembles-the-housing-projects

On his arrival in New York in 1935–36, he joined the group of artists working for the Works Progress Administration’s Federal Arts Project. He spent the years after World War II developing a personal style that was inspired by both realist and abstract influences. By the early 1950s, he left representational imagery behind entirely, developing a lyrical Abstract Expressionist style that is typified by Rite. His paintings of this period largely consist of irregular blocks of gestural strokes and marks of color floating within the picture plane, often grouped toward the center of the composition. Guston’s most radical shift came in the late 1960s, when he confounded the art world with a new figurative style in which he used blunt cartoon shapes to create a personal iconography.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/9524/rite

Instead, she captured narratives filled with anxiety and implied violence, explaining, “In horror stories or in fairy tales, the fascination with the morbid is also, at least for me, a way to prepare for the unthinkable… .

Rivers was at the height of his renown by 1964, having introduced found objects and imagery, including stencils and other forms of lettering, into his canvases. The composition of Lions on the Dreyfus Fund III is at once complex and diffuse: striding lions, jostling letters, floating tails, and muscular brushstrokes achieve a lateral push and pull.

Not surprisingly, she was an English major in college, and it was during that period that her mother gave her the collected works of Emily Dickinson—which proved to be perhaps Dill’s most significant influence. Almost all of Dill’s works contain words, and frequently they are those of Dickinson. Dill has said, “I think of words, and especially the poems of Emily Dickinson, for their embodiment of psychological states of despair and euphoria as metaphors for being, as a kind of spiritual armor, and intervening skin between ourselves and the world.” A Word Made Flesh, a series of four mixed-process prints literally transcribes the words of Dickinson onto a woman’s body. While the text is legible in Back and Throat, Dill has manipulated the language within the ghostly composition of Front to the point where only select phrases are visible: “ghastly” over the woman’s chest and “cares” (short for caress) over her stomach for example. In this series, word and image merge with forceful, yet disturbingly vulnerable, effect.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/135480/a-word-made-flesh-throat

Homer’s familiarity with the site is born out by the techniques that he used to capture the relentless churning movement of the massive wave. Although he used very little graphite in this work, he mapped out the frothy whites of the wave by making staccato marks with resist, probably using chalk for this purpose.

The medium of watercolor offered the perfect metaphor as well as technical means to express this relationship; its very wetness allows the forms of man and nature to run together, absorbed by the hazy atmosphere. In The Lone Boat, Homer constructed a nearly abstract composition along a strong horizon line, with the trees on the shore and their reflections in the water forming a symmetrical design. The effect is similar to that achieved when a still-wet sheet is folded at the center and blotted.Homer painted the sky using multiple hues and a complex array of techniques, including resist, blotting, scraping, and wet-into-wet brushwork.

Africa Restored formally references the nkisi nkondi, or power figures, of the Democratic Republic of Congo. These sculptures were crafted as basic armatures into which accretions of metals, mirrors, and nails were driven to activate their force.Affixed to the sculpture are “medallions,” or “icons,” in the form of photographic images and texts laminated in plastic that refer to both prominent and lesser-known figures within the black freedom movement in America as well as to Egyptian iconographies adopted by African Americans in the 1970s as a way to challenge dominant Western worldviews. In producing his speculative history of Africa and its diaspora, Marshall also casts his contemporaries as stars in his constellation of references—for example, the artist’s wife, artist and actor Cheryl Lynn Bruce, performs as Cleopatra. Notably, Marshall adds new elements each time the sculpture goes on view, including for this current presentation. Thus, the work can be seen as an unfinished, living sculpture—open to continued revision by the artist.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/193320/africa-restored-cheryl-as-cleopatra

Around 1935 Tobey arrived at his distinctive “white writing,” or intricate networks of calligraphic marks that densely and evenly animate a surface. When viewed from a distance, these dabs and dashes of pigment interspersed with short, overlapping lines—create a writhing, unified field of energy. In Untitled the subdued palette of lavender, white, gray, black, and burgundy functions similarly—the innumerable strokes and marks only become distinct from close-up. A smoothly painted border, which appears in much of Tobey’s oeuvre, surrounds and offsets the vibrating center. The artist felt that his delicate, teeming webs of “living line” mirrored the connections between East and West, finite and infinite, humanity and the cosmos.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/23370/untitled

usa_1081,Joseph Cornell,Box construction,Untitled (Homage to Blériot),"This box is an example of Cornell‘s ability to convey ideas and associations by minimal means. A construction of thin pieces of wood is delicately balanced from the center of the metal spring coil, on which it bounces freely. The arrangement hints at the wings and propeller of a biplane, thus relating to the title, which in earlier exhibitions was listed simply as Bleriot. Louis Bleriot (1872-1936) was a pioneering French aviator, the first to fly across the English Channel in 1909. The strongly marked wood grain, stained pale blue, of the inner wall of the box evokes both the waves of the sea, over which early planes flew low, as well as perhaps clouds in the sky. Cornell papered the back of the box with a French newspaper, L’Economiste francais (June 15, 1893). Given the subject of this box, the choice of paper backing—always an integral part of a box’s construction for the artist—seems not entirely fortuitous. Another, closely related box, referred to as Bleriot # 2, has been dated around 1956 (estate of Joseph Cornell; New York 1980–82, no. 115, ill.). It differs from this one primarily in the relationship of the components within the box.— Entry, Dawn Ades, Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1997, p. 84.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/99774/untitled-homage-to-bleriot

Marin evoked the complexity of the surf with a wide range of paint applications: dry brushstrokes for the water’s texture; intervals of wet-into-wet; amorphous washes to suggest foreground rocks; pale blue tints over white paper for sea foam; and multiple shades of black, blue, and green to evoke depth and movement below the waves.

In its near abstraction and reliance on subtle color gradations, this watercolor and others in this group suggest that Homer may have looked closely at traditional Japanese ink paintings. Tranquil in mood, the image is divided nearly in half by the horizon line, with the gray-blue sea and sky reflecting each other, separated only by bare white paper and a wet wash of bright blue along the horizon. Homer emphasized the calm sea by applying color in broad, even washes.Laying a flat wash is a fundamental technique for depicting sky and water in a landscape painting. After crossing the length of the sheet with his brush, which is loaded with color, the painter starts back in the other direction, touching the top of the brush to the bottom of the previous stroke so the wet washes merge evenly. Controlled speed is essential: if the first stroke is allowed to dry, a hard line appears and the strokes will not blend. Once the wash dries, subsequent washes can be laid over it, which is how Homer built up tone in the sea.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16821/prout-s-neck-evening

Evans’s photographs and Agee’s lengthy text were eventually published as the 1941 book Let Us Now Praise Famous Men. Agee devoted a short chapter to a local graveyard, noting the improvised nature of markers on the poorest of the burial sites, including pine boards, glasses, and old crockery. Evans photographed several such graves (a different image than this was included in the book); in this picture, he dramatically cropped the print from a full negative in order to echo the horizontal shape of the grave itself, underscoring with little flourish the poignant nature of his subject.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/69958/a-child-s-grave-hale-county-alabama

To Moholy, the photogram was the perfect teaching tool because it demonstrated the medium’s complete tonal range and revealed photography’s essence to be its sensitivity to light.

usa_1097,Joseph Cornell,Box construction,"The Eagle, the Arrow, and the Dolphin","The title of this box refers to a small section of a map of the heavens attached to the top of the box’s interior left wall. It reproduces several constellations with their Latin names, including AQUl(LA) (Eagle), SAGITTA (Arrow), and DELPHINUS (Dolphin). Cornell used the larger illustration attached to the box’s interior back wall, showing a group of constellations labeled CEPHEUS, URSA MINOR, DRACO, and CAUDA DRACONIS, in several other boxes, including Pavilion. The original image appears to have been photographically reproduced, and then partially colored in by hand by Cornell himself. The artist used it again in Cauda Draconis of 1958 (New York, Xavier Fourcade, Inc.; Waldman 1977, pl. 33), a box that offers a close comparison to The Eagle, the Arrow, and the Dolphin. Both boxes are horizontal in their construction and include metal rods supporting a rolling ball. The Eagle, the Arrow, and the Dolphin,, however, has two metal rings rather than one and lacks the row of wine glasses with blue marble balls arranged on a shelf in Cauda Draconis.A comparison between Pavilion and The Eagle, the Arrow, and the Dolphon draws attention not only to their shared imagery but also to an interesting similarity in their formal construction. Although one box is vertical and the other horizontal, the spatial divisions created by the wood or metal rods, which function as either “columns” or “shelves,” seem to follow the same proportional rules. Strong geometric and structural principles often underlie the heterogeneous collections of materials and objects within Cornell‘s boxes.The study of the constellations had many layers of significance for the artist Constellations were connected to ancient mythology and bore witness to the power of the human imagination to imprint images and patterns on chaos. The illustration pasted into these boxes exemplifies these aspects in its particularly pleasing combination of science and fantasy. Cornell associated favorite constellations, such as Andromeda, Orion, and the Dragon, with friends, film stars, or ballerinas. The very term “ constellation” took on a particular significance for him in his effort to understand and describe his working process, as he sought patterns in his experiences, his feelings, and his works. A handwritten note in his diary reads: “What about ‘constellations’ for experiments in going over past experiences on various subjects and picking out certain points for a presentation” (Cornell Papers, AAA, reel 1060; see Cornell 1993, p. 227).— Entry, Dawn Ades, Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1997, p. 88-89.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/99770/the-eagle-the-arrow-and-the-dolphin

Louis’s saturated stripes and misty veils of color were achieved through a careful process of staining sheets of raw canvas, hung from vertical scaffolding, with thin washes of plastic-based paints.

Seaside tourism in New England—a subject portrayed here by Carlsen and, more famously, by Winslow Homer (on view nearby)—increased in popularity during the late 19th century, offering a respite from growing industrialism.Trained in architecture in Copenhagen, Carlsen immigrated in 1872 to Chicago, shifting his focus to painting.

usa_1121,Andy Warhol,Color screenprint on cream card,Marilyn Monroe (Marilyn),"Due in part to his experience as a highly successful commercial illustrator in the 1950s, Andy Warhol was as much businessman as artist and understood the value of mass production and distribution. By the early 1960s, screenprinting had become the favored medium for commercial printing jobs, such as labels and signage. It was used to quickly reproduce photographic images on almost any flat surface. By 1962 Warhol had begun using it to put repeated images on his canvases—images that he had previously painted painstakingly by hand. Because Warhol had not finessed the process, his printing “mistakes” became a signature. In 1967 he began publishing limited-edition print portfolios in his studio under the aegis of Factory Editions.Marilyn was the first such portfolio, consisting of ten images made from the same 1953 publicity photograph of Marilyn Monroe in the film Niagara, which Warhol transformed with intentionally off-register printing and garish combinations of psychedelic colors. Daylight fluorescent colors, better known as Day-Glo colors, were invented in the 1930s, and by the 1960s had become integral to the graphic vocabulary of Pop art. While a conventional bright color reflects 80 to 90 percent of its color, a Day-Glo color appears to reflect more than 300 percent of its color. It is no wonder then that art historian Robert Rosenblum observed that Marilyn’s face “seems perpetually illuminated by the afterimage of a flashbulb.” With this method and presentation, Warhol and his work became synonymous with Pop Art.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/149983/marilyn-monroe-marilyn

Living in Paris in the 1950s, the artist came under the influence of the Impressionist painters Claude Monet and Paul Cézanne, as well as their early 20th-century successors Pierre Bonnard and Henri Matisse. After viewing Monet’s Nympheas at L’Orangerie in 1953, Francis transformed his palette from pale grays and muted hues to an explosive mixture of primary colors.

Her works center on these public performances but often culminate in photographs or videos. Beecroft blurs the boundary between art and fashion to the point that, in recent years, eminent designers have provided the attire for her models. Adopting the fashion industry’s use of sex as a sales tool and openly presenting women as a silent visual spectacle, she engages with structures of power and economies of desire while provocatively toying with cultural expectations of female sexuality.In Piano Americano, two women in beige trench coats sit decorously in chairs, facing the camera, while to their left a woman in a bright green party dress sprawls on the floor. Behind them, nine women in flesh-colored underwear mill around, looking aloof or bored, occasionally squatting down or running their hands along the wall. Over the course of half an hour, the camera slowly pans across the different groupings of women. Eventually it begins to zoom in on their faces and their bodies, both enacting and eliciting the viewer’s lingering gaze. Beecroft’s work partakes in the voyeuristic dynamics of sexual consumerism with a degree of self-conscious complicity, but she also denaturalizes these patterns and invites the viewer’s discomfort. Beecroft has said, “I like to display nudity to provoke the fear or embarrassment or the confusion of the audience.” Poised between eroticism and cool, structured formalism, her living displays are suggestive but emotionally vacant, demonstrating an aloof yet potentially aggressive sexuality.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/184184/piano-americano

Despite its abstracted forms, components of the lantern (probably a Coleman arc lantern) are recognizable, among them the two glowing mantles, the perforated collar with its black fuel valve, and the pump plunger. He employed a shimmering silver paint to depict the lantern’s globe as a flat, circular form, further marking his willingness to explore unusual materials.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/65864/lantern

usa_1142,Joseph Cornell,Box construction,Untitled (For Trista),"This box may have been the last one Cornell ever made. He dedicated it to Trista Stern (born 1960), eldest daughter of the ballerina Allegra Kent and the photographer Bert Stern. Cornell met Kent in 1956, and they were particularly close in 1969. As Kent recalled, “My greatest rapport with Joseph came on a visit August 13, 1969. I was very depressed … I went out to see Joseph and we lost ourselves talking about music, nature and shells” (Allegra Kent, “Joseph Cornell: A Reminiscence,” in New York, Castelli, Feigen, Corcoran, Joseph Cornell Portfolio, 1976, exh. cat., n. pag.).Like so many of Cornell‘s boxes, this is a game, which can only be fully revealed when it is manipulated. The map is a comparative chart of the world’s rivers, as its title informs us. It is, in other words, an imaginary map, and the blank area at its heart, resembling a map of the Arctic or Antarctic, is a purely notional “source” point. At its center is an orienting compass, the only part of the map visible when the back panel is closed. Although topographical charts appear relatively infrequently in Cornell’s work, compared with maps of the heavens ancient or modern, the ingenious character of this one must have appealed to him.Three objects move freely on top of the plywood panel: a metal globe, a hollow blue plastic cube, and a red wooden bead. Each can be caught in the hole in the panel by tilting the box, which may well have been conceived to work horizontally, as well as vertically, based on the orientation of the inscriptions on the back (see Untitled (Black Hunter). Rather than the navigation boxes, to which it has a superficial resemblance, this box strongly recalls the educational, “philosophical” toy so popular with the Victorians: a lesson about the world and its dimensions.— Entry, Dawn Ades, Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1997, p. 96-97.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/99772/untitled-for-trista

The moon, a shimmering blue circle, is enlarged and surrounded with a dynamic aura. Both moon and tanks are seen in close proximity, making the moon appear equal to the tanks.

The contrast between this yellow sun and the white cork balls, which by association become moons, is echoed in the white and yellow dots of paint, meticulously formed into circles, for all their apparently random splattering.

The photographer operated galleries throughout his life, using them as a platform to present his vision of modern art in America; he also treated his last gallery, An American Place, as a site for artistic creativity in its own right. The Art Institute was one of several major museums to receive gifts from Stieglitz’s collection—via O’Keeffe, his executor—in 1949; these donations often marked (as here) the institutions’ first acquisition of photographs as art.For more on the Alfred Stieglitz collection at the Art Institute, along with in-depth object information, please visit the website: The Alfred Stieglitz Collection.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/66567/from-my-window-at-an-american-place-north
usa_1168,Joseph Cornell,Box construction,Untitled (Game),"In a diary entry for March 1960, Cornell pointed to the centrality of the idea of a game or toy for his boxes:“Perhaps a definition of the box could be as a kind of ‘forgotten game,’ a philosophical toy of the Victorian era, with poetic or magical ‘moving parts,’ … that golden age of the toy alone should justify the ‘box’s’ existence” (Cornell Papers, AAA, reel 1060, Mar. 1960).Although Cornell here related the idea of the toy to the Victorian era, it was not incompatible with the notion of Surrealist object that had been an important source for him. The second time Cornell‘s works were shown by Julien Levy, in a joint exhibition with etchings by Pablo Picasso (Nov.–Dec. 1932), they were presented under a variety of headings in the exhibition announcement: “Minutiae, Glass Bells, Shadow Boxes [cutout figures and montages], Coups d’oeil, and Jouets surrealistes [Surrealist toys].” Levy thus recognized, in the very multiplicity of these categories, that Cornell’s constructions were not easily classified under conventional labels, and acknowledged the toy as an important reference.The notion of the “Surrealist toy” may be understood as one of Cornell‘s responses to the complex and elastic idea of the Surrealist object. A toy or game normally involves movement in the object and the active participation of the player (s). In addition to the early puzzle boxes and the optical and kinetic games with which Cornell tinkered, there are two Surrealist sources for the game boxes. One is the Surrealist object as conceived by Salvador Dalí in 1931 (see Salvador Dalí, “Objects surrealistes,”Le Surrealisme au service de La revolution 3 [Dec. 1931]); the other is found in Marcel Duchamp’s work. The immediate inspiration for Dali’s type of object was Alberto Giacometti’s Suspended Ball (1930–31; Yves Bonnefoy, Alberto Giacomelli: A Biography of His Work, Paris, 1991, pl. 176), the difference between this and the Surrealist object with symbolic function being that the latter was to be constructed of ready-made, found materials, rather than traditional sculptural ones. Cornell was certainly aware of Giacometti’s Suspended Ball by the time he made his construction Ball and Book in 1934 (Art of this Century, New York 1942, exh. cat., p. 149; and New York, 1980–82, no. 63, ill.), but unlike Giacometti he significantly refrained in his construction from any erotic over tones. He seems to have felt more kinship with the readymades and “readymades aides” (assisted readymades) of Duchamp. Duchamp was the first person literally to introduce movement into his work in his Bicycle Wheel of 1913 (original lost; Pontus Hulten, ed., Marcel Duchamp: Work and Life, Cambridge, Mass., 1993, p. 30, ill.), but more relevant to Cornell’s work are Duchamp’s With Hidden Noise (1916)—the first object to incorporate noise as an element—and Why Not Sneeze Rrose Selavy (1921, both in the Philadelphia Museum of Art; Hulten 1993, pp. 63, 79, ills.). The secretive character of the former would certainly have appealed to him. Duchamp’s With Hidden Noise, enigmatic as it is, looks however like a machine part forgotten on a factory floor, its invisible, rattling innards the result of a random oversight; Cornell’s game boxes resemble in stead toys long relegated to the attic, the noise generated by rolling ball rattling counter clearly part of their original function as games, whose rules or objectives have long since been forgotten.Although this particular game box invites handling, its orientation is uncertain. It was reproduced horizontally in the catalogue for The Museum of Modern Art’s Cornell retrospective (New York 1980–82, no. 185, ill.), but it is currently installed at the Art Institute in a vertical position. Positioned vertically, it resembles certain Sand-Fountain Boxes.— Entry, Dawn Ades, Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1997, p. 43-44.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/99763/untitled-game

The Return, Tynemouth depicts two fishermen who have arrived on shore in early morning. Because this watercolor was painted with light-fast pigments, it retains the pale, orange-pink washes that have faded from many of the extant watercolors he painted with fugitive red pigments; for this reason, it offers a more complete idea of his developing powers in decorative color. Homer’s study of the British Library’s drawings by Michelangelo and Raphael during this 1881-82 trip to England may have improved his skill for rendering figures in motion, which are emphasized here by the artist’s graphite underdrawing.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/113064/the-return-tynemouth-recto-study-verso

usa_1196,Nicole Eisenman,Oil and charcoal on canvas,The Drawing Class,"The artists depicted in The Drawing Class, who study a crudely rendered nude model,embody human and inhuman characteristics. Their blank stares and closed mouths suggest an overall feeling of calm and contemplation. Eisenman disturbed this, however, with violent scratch marks that wipe out a figure’s face and distortions of the female form. She objectified the female figure through the alien appearance of the model and the exaggerated anatomy depicted in a painting on the wall. Within a complex back-and-forth of gazes, the viewer appears to stand in for an artist, locking eyes with the model. A mirror leaning against the studio’s back wall contains a blurred reflection that allows yet another entry point for the viewer. According to artist Amy Sillman, “The gaze is critical [in Eisenman’s work]. We look at someone as they look at someone or something, creating instant shame at the self-consciousness involved in being seen, being judged, being aware of the moment.”Nicole Eisenman has made narrative drawings, paintings, and installations with an irreverent sense of humor since the early 1990s. She was originally dubbed a “bad-girl” painter for her emotionally charged content, which often included feminist inspired takes on female subjects. She combines historical elements of painting—from Renaissance to modern art—with appeals to popular culture, including pornography, horror films, and punk music. Her complex narratives always involve the human figure, whether alone or in a crowd, to evoke feelings of anxiety, fear, and isolation.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/209580/the-drawing-class

During the 1910s, influenced by the works of Paul Cézanne, Henri Matisse, and Pablo Picasso, he produced numerous compositions, including Still Life No. 15, a spare arrangement of a white goblet holding a lone pink flower against a backdrop of cream and blue fabric. Unlike many works by Hartley from this period, which emphasize the two-dimensionality of his canvases, here he conveyed a sense of the shallow dark space behind the arrangement on its skewed tabletop. Using a dry, brushy style, Hartley suggested the volumetric presence of the objects through the shading that accentuates the form of the goblet and the deep folds of the fabric.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/65930/still-life-no-15

usa_1215,Andy Warhol,Color screenprint on cream card,Marilyn Monroe (Marilyn),"Due in part to his experience as a highly successful commercial illustrator in the 1950s, Andy Warhol was as much businessman as artist and understood the value of mass production and distribution. By the early 1960s, screenprinting had become the favored medium for commercial printing jobs, such as labels and signage. It was used to quickly reproduce photographic images on almost any flat surface. By 1962 Warhol had begun using it to put repeated images on his canvases—images that he had previously painted painstakingly by hand. Because Warhol had not finessed the process, his printing “mistakes” became a signature. In 1967 he began publishing limited-edition print portfolios in his studio under the aegis of Factory Editions.Marilyn was the first such portfolio, consisting of ten images made from the same 1953 publicity photograph of Marilyn Monroe in the film Niagara, which Warhol transformed with intentionally off-register printing and garish combinations of psychedelic colors. Daylight fluorescent colors, better known as Day-Glo colors, were invented in the 1930s, and by the 1960s had become integral to the graphic vocabulary of Pop art. While a conventional bright color reflects 80 to 90 percent of its color, a Day-Glo color appears to reflect more than 300 percent of its color. It is no wonder then that art historian Robert Rosenblum observed that Marilyn’s face “seems perpetually illuminated by the afterimage of a flashbulb.” With this method and presentation, Warhol and his work became synonymous with Pop Art.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/150051/marilyn-monroe-marilyn

Shaw excelled at painting Romantic scenes of imaginary Arcadian landscapes. In Solitude, a male figure reclines in the foreground, with the contemplative pose and seminude state of a poet or philosopher inspired by the beauty of nature. In addition to idealized compositions such as this one, Shaw painted landscapes in watercolor based on observations of various locales along the Eastern Seaboard. Shaw was a generation older than Thomas Cole and other artists of the country’s first school of landscape painting, the Hudson River School, which emerged in the second quarter of the 19th century.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/183293/solitude

A miniscule daub of blue paint on the rocks in the foreground suggests the presence of a figure and, in turn, signals the immensity of nature, visualized here as a place of spiritual transcendence.

After several rebellious years of study at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, the artist moved to New York for a few years before traveling to Paris in 1936. During this time, his style became more abstract as he was continually exposed to the work of Cubists, Surrealists, and other modern artists. An artist who worked on a diligent schedule, Biederman devoted himself to daily executions of new works. Careful analysis and x-ray imaging have revealed that he strategically planned out his forms before painting, and several graphite lines can still be seen along the edges of color fields and below the paint surface. The central form contains subtle shading and color gradations, which give this multidirectional shape additional volume, foreshadowing his later sculptural constructions.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/214080/untitled-paris-march-1937

The white interior, with its beading and planks of wood, appears at first sight to be deserted, as does that of another box of these years, Toward the “Blue Peninsula” (1951–52, Geneva, Daniel Varenne; New York 1980–82, pl. XXVII), However, whereas the blue sky, the open cage, and the single bird‘s feather in that evocative box signal escape, in Yellow Chamber the birds are hidden or trapped, visible only in a series of mirror reflections.The “chamber” of the title reinforces the ambiguity of the interior space, which has strong associations with both architecture and a bird’s cage. It suggests both enforced enclosure—the locked chambers of fairy tales and hotel rooms (chambres). The unusual presence of two parakeets hints at a “ double room.” The spatial games Cornell played with mirrors here indeed evoke a double room with in the restricted area of the box. The title, Yellow Chamber; seems to refer to the yellow wall visible through the holes in the white wooden plank to the right (not visible in this photograph), and also hints at a particular, but unknown, story or history. The formal effect of the mirroring is to give the box an asymmetrical, rectilinear geometry, lightened and balanced by the circular elements (ring, holes, beads, springs).— Entry, Dawn Ades, Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1997, p.66-67.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/99787/yellow-chamber

In this watercolor, the central motif is boldly rendered in strong, bright colors, the complementary relationship of blue and yellow giving the impression of sharp focus. Around the perimeter of the scene, the artist painted with water to dilute and blend pigment, blotting and wiping away the paint to create a blurry border that suggests peripheral vision or even the view through the lens of a camera.

As a former amphetamine addict and convicted felon, his documentary images of sex, violence, and drug abuse are often autobiographical. In exposing aspects of American youth subculture, Clark presents photographs that are at once journalistic and oddly romantic, garnering a mix of sharp criticism and admiration for his discomfiting honesty.Tulsa (1971), the artist’s first photo-essay, chronicles the disintegration of the American dream through depictions of reckless adolescents participating in self-destructive activities. Considered together in book form, his photographs constitute a memoir of sorts; Clark records misspent adolescence from an insider’s perspective. The result is shockingly raw imagery that possesses a gritty intimacy, simultaneously appealing and appalling to the viewer.Larry Clark’s brutally frank personal testament has achieved almost mythic status. In revealing his own personal involvement as both participant and voyeur, Tulsa set the precedent for an entire generation of artists engaged in the exploration of taboo subject matter. Clark chose the ten images that comprise this portfolio as a selection of the most iconic images from Tulsa.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/184104/tulsa

The distorted facial features and the distinctive textures of the hair and dress imbue the portrait with an exaggerated “primitiveness,” which engage widely held stereotypes.

During this period Maher developed a system of design that he called the “motif rhythm theory,” in which he created a signature motif to harmonize the interior and exterior of a house through the repetition of decorative details based on local natural forms. He frequently collaborated with Louis J. Millet on his commissions, including the Patrick J. King House (1901), from which this fireplace surround came. This extraordinary object is composed of glass mosaics and features one of Maher’s most prominent motifs, the stylized thistle. It is delicately rendered in shades ranging from pale seafoam green to vibrant greens, blues, and yellows. The fireplace surround is an outstanding example of Millet’s exacting execution of Maher’s designs.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/208516/fireplace-surround

Upon his return to New York, Dove joined the circle of artists at Alfred Stieglitz’s 291 gallery, and he became the first American painter to experiment with pure abstraction in works like From a Wasp. Employing subdued colors, perhaps in acknowledgement of the tones of Analytic Cubism, Dove created a tightly focused, highly abstract composition that renders the curving forms of a wasp’s body as a series of overlapping planes.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/65871/from-a-wasp

Transporting his fragile equipment on mule or carriage through difficult terrain, Watkins used a “mammoth-plate” camera whose glass negatives measured up to 18 by 22 inches and yielded remarkably detailed prints of the same size. He favored spectacular compositions with dramatic spatial depth. In this photograph, Watkins depicted Yosemite Valley’s immense span through the receding planes of mountains and the giant Sequoia trees that frame them. Watkins printed more than 1,100 mammoth-plate photographs over the course of his career. Unfortunately, the majority of his glass negatives and prints were destroyed in the San Francisco earthquake and fire of 1906.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/105101/first-view-of-the-yosemite-valley-from-the-mariposa-trail

He conjured the shape of a shrub by subtracting pigment, perhaps with the handle of his brush, adding touches of blue to draw the eye into the haze.

Symons traveled extensively in pursuit of artistic subjects, maintaining studios in a number of locations, including Colrain, Massachusetts, where he likely created The Winter Sun. He especially enjoyed the challenges of depicting wintry landscapes, which he largely completed outside in the elements. Symons’s approach in such mature works had a forceful breadth that critics saw as particularly American in character.

Using wet-plate glass negatives, a cumbersome and labor-intensive technology that did not allow for images of active battle, O’Sullivan concentrated on the war’s harrowing aftermath. This photograph depicts a scene following the Battle of Gettysburg, one of the war’s bloodiest confrontations, in which thousands of men on both sides lost their lives. The lifeless, exposed bodies of the six soldiers who appear in the photograph had been picked over by survivors searching for shoes and other valuables.

Dove evoked the wetness of the scene by employing metallic paint on a steel plate; these unconventional materials makes the entire composition shimmer and shine.

He often depicted fisherfolk in the village and neighboring areas, as in Tynemouth Priory, England, in which a woman and two fishermen occupy a coble that is floating in choppy waters off the coast, and a fisherman wearing yellow gear is busy hauling in a net, presumably filled with the day’s catch. A ruined castle and priory that dominate the coast near Tynemouth are visible in the righthand background; Homer would have seen this view daily from his rented studio overlooking Cullercoats Harbor. The artist’s use of transparent gray wash for the ruins makes them appear ghostly and desolate in the mist.

By interrupting expected graphic identities, Knight’s work questions how branding and design affect the understanding of objects, and at times institutions. Museotypes depicts 60 international museums, not by their logos or facades, but as floor plans on bone-china dinner plates. In this ironically commemorative series, the plates simultaneously venerate their subjects as collectable items and reduce them to commercially available, limited-edition souvenirs. Thus, the museum is literally put on display, and as the artist explained, the work as a whole becomes “a representation of the museum and its role in culture.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/102236/museotypes

With these textual juxtapositions, Kruger calls out the societal pressures on women to bear children.

For this watercolor, Marin started his sketch of the island in graphite rather than charcoal, allowing for greater precision. Yet he playfully set it against the mountainous profile of Mount Desert, a view that could not in reality have been seen from the same vantage point. Marin employed a particularly expressionistic handling of watercolor here: contours are jagged and black, and the paint is heavily manipulated. An electric blue sky, animated by circular wiping, is energized by the single line of yellow marking the contour of the island. The artist’s passionate orchestration of movement, color, and mood map the fluctuation of a turbulent sea, while the reflective silver frame and mount contribute to the sense of dynamism and excitement.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/65987/sea-movement-green-and-blue

O’Keeffe’ s invitation came at a good moment, because Marin was feeling the need to explore new territory and escape what he called “living in herds” in Manhattan. Marin had also been tempted to visit the West by his friend the painter Marsden Hartley’s vivid descriptions of the landscape. During the summers of 1929 and 1930 Marin lived and painted in New Mexico, following the lead of several of the artists who congregated around the 291 gallery in New York.

This sculpture depicts the Snake Dance, a Hopi prayer for rain in which priests run from the high mesa to the plains while grasping handfuls of snakes. MacNeil achieved a new level of dynamism that reflected the thrill of the spectacle, as described by his friend, the author Hamlin Garland: “They had rushed four miles at top speed, but they mounted the trail toward Walpi with incredible celerity.

In The Essex Canal, a waterway faintly meanders from the green-hued foreground to a skim of blue along the horizon, with an expansive sky beyond.

A somber portrait of the sea by one who understood its character intimately, the work alludes to a gradual envelopment by nothingness, aging, and death. Yet it possesses energy and excitement: splashes of green and red shimmer though the gray mists, while calligraphic black lines activate the surf and air.

This tedious, labor-intensive process, which the artist originated, relies on the tactile, dotlike forms of the cotton balls to compose a pictorial field.

usa_1350,Robert Mangold,Acrylic and black pencil on canvas,Green/2 Orange X Painting,"Robert Mangold is an American Minimalist painter best known for painted canvases that incorporate drawn line, exalting simplified means and structure. Over the course of the last 50 years, he has employed a variety of geometric forms—circles, ellipses, squares, rectangles, trapezoids—as the support for his pared-down compositions. From 1980 to 1986, the artist created a series of paintings based on the letter X and the plus sign. Green/2 Orange X Painting is composed of three conjoined canvases of unequal size and three distinct colors—two oranges and a green. Drawn lines of unequal length mark the axis of the cross, replicating the overall shape within the plane and unifying the composition. Here the physical presence of the canvas edge becomes the central formal motif; the structural skeleton of painting becomes the subject of the work.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/204637/green-2-orange-x-painting

Three years later,he began Lynch Fragments, a series of welded steel assemblages made in response to the tumultuous social climate of the Civil Rights movement. Edwards addressed African American identity within an abstract sculptural language. Afrophoenix No. 1, one of the earliest objects from the series, exemplifies how the artist physically transformed found objects and brought them together in poetically suggestive, tension-filled compositions. Here the formal arrangement of steel elements evokes an equestrian bridle and bit. Chains, hammers, nails, spikes, and screws magnify the sculpture’s associative power, recalling implements of labor and torture. At the same time, the title references the mythological phoenix—alluding to death, rebirth, and transformation. Suggesting a range of meanings, the work demonstrates Edwards’s desire to fuse abstraction with personal and collective histories.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/147604/afrophoenix-no-1

usa_1353,Charles White,"Charcoal, with smudging, erasing and scratching, on tan wove paper, laid down",Portrait of a Woman,"Charles White dedicated himself to portraying the African American community with dignity. Contrary to stereotypical representations of African Americans common during the postwar era, White consistently depicted his subjects as strong and proud. An immensely talented draftsman, White wanted others to be conscious of the pride he had in his people, and he believed that art was the most appropriate tool for relaying this message to the public. White focused on African American women during the 1950s and throughout his career, even devoting a solo exhibition in New York to the subject. For this show White created pieces that honored the strength of black women including works such as Harriet Tubman (1949; private collection) and Mother (1945; National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.). When asked about the exhibition, White explained the the African American woman deserves “a great deal more recognition for the never-ending sacrifices she has made and the continuing leadership she has given in the struggles of the Negro people for full equality.”During this time, White created Portrait of a Woman, 1950, which shows a contemporary working-class African American woman. The subject’s large eyes are inviting and warm, but the noticeable bags, along with her wrinkled face, imply that her life has been hard. Plainly clothed with simply styled hair and no jewelry, she is obviously a commoner, but White’s depiction suggests that although she may not be conventionally beautiful or important, she still has her dignity. Furthermore, her striking doleful eyes address the viewer directly in a tender gaze.Increasingly leftist in his political views, White’s admiration for the working classes is visible in his murals, his paintings, and his works on paper. White chose to focus not only on inequalities and degradation experienced by African Americans, but also the humanity and beauty he saw in them. White’s Portrait of a Woman celebrates his subject by portraying her as valuable and worthy of not only his artistic representation, but also of our respect. Through masterful renditions such as Portrait of a Woman, White offered an alternative, uplifting narrative of the African American experience.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/117417/portrait-of-a-woman

The pictographs represent the artist’s first efforts at reconciling elements of abstraction with an exploration of the unconscious drawn from Surrealism. His aim was to create a new, uniquely American expression that would bring significant content to abstraction. The ideas Gottlieb explored in Pictographs are so varied and complex that the series occupied him for more than 10 years. Crypt was created in the course of Gottlieb’s intensive exploration of the pictograph theme.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/111808/crypt
usa_1363,Doug Aitken,"Color film, sound, transferred to three-channel digital video (projections on three attached screens); 4:10 min. loop Edition number four of four",thaw,"Doug Aitken’s acclaimed video installations take aim at what it means to live in an age when human experience is increasingly shaped by the mediating effects of technology and an unprecedented degree of mobility. Many of his videos unfold as journeys through desolate places in which the natural and the artificial begin to blend. Others offer technology-inflected visions of landscapes in a state of flux. Aitken described his body of work as a series of “structures which move outward in different trajectories and yet share a connection.” He went on to say, “If I create a work which is intensely human, then maybe the next work I want to make is as far from that as possible. It is a constantly evolving process of point and counterpoint.” The three works by Aitken in the Art Institute’s collection—monsoon, thaw, and the moment—vary in their formal qualities and subject matter, but they all pursue similar themes. Additionally, they provide a sense of how Aitken has used the spatial configurations of his multichannel installations in increasingly ambitious ways to extend his films’ narratives beyond the edges of the screen.Another of Aitken’s voyages—in this case to a glacier in Alaska—inspired thaw, which depicts a landscape that is austere and seemingly free from the touch of human history. In this three-channel projection, expansive views of moving clouds and bright sun give way to images of melting snow and sheets of ice breaking off into the exposed sea. Perhaps first and foremost, thaw is an overtly sensual experience, filtered through and heightened by technology. At times, the images on the angled, adjoining screens merge to create an expansive panorama, while at other moments Aitken inverts an image to produce a disorienting effect or introduces an unexpected sensation of rhythm by juxtaposing close-ups of cracking ice or water droplets. Meanwhile, the layered, pulsing audio track contributes to a sense of volatility and movement, amplifying the quality of technological mediation as one views the glacial landscape. For the audio, the artist recorded ambient noises on location and later combined them with additional sounds that he synthesized electronically. Presenting a fractured, kinetic portrait of this place, he conveys through largely formal means the hidden dynamism of the arctic terrain as it shifts between solid and liquid states.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/159828/thaw

It was used to quickly reproduce photographic images on almost any flat surface. By 1962 Warhol had begun using it to put repeated images on his canvases—images that he had previously painted painstakingly by hand.

While a conventional bright color reflects 80 to 90 percent of its color, a Day-Glo color appears to reflect more than 300 percent of its color.

usa_1383,Joseph Cornell,"Collage composed of cut and pasted, commercially printed papers and gray wove paper, on untempered masonite",Untitled (Collage #36),"Cornell worked on both the front and back of this masonite board. Based on the inscription, he preferred the side made of collaged color photographs, showing a female figurehead emerging from a tree-shaded garden, and regarded it as the front. Cornell‘s usual practice in his boxes was to work all surfaces, and he often extended this practice to his collages, which are, like this one, frequently double-sided.His preference in this case for one side over the other throws light on what it was that Cornell regarded as “successful.” He may have been aiming to achieve similar effects by different means on the two different sides of this collage. Broadly speaking, we could locate these effects with in the Surrealist notion of depaysement, that is, the disorientation of the viewer, through the displacement and odd combination of familiar objects and settings.On the front, the sculpture of a woman is set in a wood land garden, composed of tree trunks, azaleas, Japanese maples, and shade-loving flowers in the foreground nature, in other words, carefully tended in it s luxuriance. The carved figure of the woman is probably a ship‘s figurehead, though the raised arm and flowing hail also recall French allegorical images of Liberty. She “sails” across the woodland floor like a galleon, thriving on the disorientation of place, on being “out of her element,” and enhancing, by her association with the sea, the green underwater atmosphere of the wood. She also resembles the type of eighteenth-century, animated garden statue seen, for example, in the park settings of Jean Antoine Watteau‘s paintings.The other side of the collage inverts this idea. Here, “nature” is trapped inside the glass jar—not just in the form of a still life (nature morte, or dead nature) of grapes and other fruits, but in the form of a “live” linnet as well. The watch face set into the bottle just below the stopper also reinforces a connection with Joseph Wright of Derby’s Experiment on a Bird in the Air Pump (1768, London, National Gallery; Judy Egerton, Wright of Del’ by, London, Tate Gallery, 1990, exh. cat., no. 21, ill), in which a dove is placed within a glass jar and sacrificed to a timed scientific experiment in a vacuum.Cornell may have thus preferred the front because the sense of enclosure, of nature trapped, was too complete on the back. The sense of depaysement, which he planned to achieve through contrasting effects on both sides, was too disturbing, conceived in terms of life and death. In the woodland scene on the front, Cornell was able to achieve a gentler kind of disruption by emphasizing what links rather than separates the images.— Entry, Dawn Ades, Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1997, p. 98-99.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/99794/untitled-collage-36

Rather than focusing on what the women are watching, Homer chose to explore the act of looking. Homer, a keen and thoughtful observer himself, was fascinated with the experience of watching. In this watercolor, he associated visual observation with physical sensations: the feeling of strong breezes, moisture in the air, and the chill of an overcast day. Because it allowed Homer to work outdoors quickly, watercolor was the perfect medium to make these atmospheric effects tangible and immediate.

Painting a mixture of powdered charcoal and dilute black watercolor over pale washes, he wiped horizontal and circular marks to suggest rock formations.

With more than 25,000 published photographs—including more than 1,000 magazine covers—Shay has shaped the way we see the world on the printed page.Born in the Bronx, Shay took up photography at the age of 12. He served in the U.S. Air Force in World War II, and his first published photographs—of an American military air disaster—were printed in a September 1944 issue of the weekly magazine Look. After the war, he joined Time and Life magazines, writing stories that he occasionally supplemented with his own (uncredited) images. In 1948 he moved to Chicago and took up photography full-time. In the nearly seven decades since, Shay’s camera has documented the famous and the downtrodden, the international and the local, the newsworthy and the intimate.Of particular significance in Shay’s career was his long friendship with the writer Nelson Algren (American, 1909–1981); the two met in 1949 and collaborated on several books and other projects. Together Shay and Algren roamed Chicago’s neighborhoods to document the lives and culture of the city’s down-and-out, and the photographer’s many pictures of the writer on those forays combine to form a multifaceted portrait.— Permanent collection label“A lifelong White Sox fan, Algren suffered through their misfortunes as nervously as any Cub fan of our own age. As a kid he had lived through the Black Sox scandal and knew the details well enough to write authoritatively about it. Once he and Studs Terkel were passengers in my 1949 Pontiac. I can still hear them groaning about “The Swede,” an unlikely culprit, and the verbal fencing over the batting averages of the Black Sox and their fates. Studs would eventually script and appear in the definitive Black Sox scandal movie: Eight Men Out. It became Algren’s pleasure to take Simone de Beauvoir to ball games. He was charmed by her fixation on the way ballplayers scratched their genitals and by their body language in general. He especially loved her misreading the score as “114,000,523 to 026,000,112.”’—Art Shay",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/191358/nelson-algren-pauses-after-another-white-sox-loss-chicago
usa_1413,William Penhallow Henderson,Oil on cardboard,Ready for the Fiesta,"William Penhallow Henderson first visited Santa Fe, New Mexico, as early as the 1880s and made a painting trip to the Southwest in 1904; he relocated to Santa Fe permanently in 1916. Like Victor Higgins and Walter Ufer, Henderson enjoyed the financial support of Chicago industrialists. Unlike his two colleagues, however, Henderson was rejected by the Taos Society of Artists; in response, he formed a Modernist group, the New Mexico Painters, in 1923. Ready for the Fiesta displays Henderson’s reliance on strong, decorative shapes and color, and the flattened picture plane and intensified geometry of the design are a result of his time spent in France studying the work of Paul Cézanne.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/104289/ready-for-the-fiesta

He met the Spanish artist in Paris while studying there in 1905–08, and at that time acquired one of Picasso’s still lifes—which became the first painting by Picasso to enter the United States. After his return to New York, Weber developed an expressive and increasingly sophisticated Cubist style. In Still Life, he rendered diverse elements in a complex and dynamic arrangement. The calligraphic handling of line energizes the forms of the composition, and the short, choppy brushwork breaks the pictorial space into planes. Although American critics, unfamiliar with or antagonistic toward modern painting, frequently responded harshly to Weber’s figural paintings, his still lifes met with approval, establishing him as the most advanced artist working in New York before the Armory Show.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/210386/still-life

Working with cartographers and natural scientists, O’Sullivan documented lands unexplored by non-Native Americans, providing highly detailed photographs such as this image of Canyon de Chelly in northwestern northeastern Arizona, which had been continuously inhabited by the Anasazi and Navajo for nearly 5,000 years. Here O’Sullivan depicted the White House ruins, the striations of the canyon wall, and two small figures below, conveying the site’s monumental character.

This incised line is not continued to the right of the central form, where, squeezed somewhat to the side, is a fragment of a color reproduction of Giovanni Battista Tiepolo’s fresco Cleopatra and Mark Antony at the Harbor from the ballroom of the Palazzo Labia, Venice (see Sacheverell Sitwell, ed., Great Houses of Europe, London, 1961, pp. 183 [ill.], 85). Cornell‘s chosen portion is from the right-hand side of the scene, showing only the secondary figures; the tiara, which gives the collage its title, is being carried on a blue cushion by a page and is possibly about to be offered to Cleopatra. This fragment introduces a group of figures into the composition in a manner similar to the celestial, mythological figures in Pavilion. The dog could perhaps be a reference to the constellation Canis. A formal connection between Tiepolo’s painting and the collage as a whole is established through the white stone globe, an architectural fragment at the center of the group of figures, which recalls the form of the moon.— Entry, Dawn Ades, Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1997, p. 92-93.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/99792/the-tiara

From 1977 until 1984, Prince presented as his own work rephotographed advertisements from magazines. Liberated from their initial context, the images, or details of images, took on a fantastic quality, one that kept in play the aura of desire, money, and power fuelling all consumer culture while adding dimensions of instability and true freedom that consumerism is designed to repress. In this photograph fashion sheaths its wearer like a condom, making a man-part out of a woman while cloaking manliness in a feminine accoutrement.

usa_1448,Andy Warhol,Color screenprint on cream card,Marilyn Monroe (Marilyn),"Due in part to his experience as a highly successful commercial illustrator in the 1950s, Andy Warhol was as much businessman as artist and understood the value of mass production and distribution. By the early 1960s, screenprinting had become the favored medium for commercial printing jobs, such as labels and signage. It was used to quickly reproduce photographic images on almost any flat surface. By 1962 Warhol had begun using it to put repeated images on his canvases—images that he had previously painted painstakingly by hand. Because Warhol had not finessed the process, his printing “mistakes” became a signature. In 1967 he began publishing limited-edition print portfolios in his studio under the aegis of Factory Editions.Marilyn was the first such portfolio, consisting of ten images made from the same 1953 publicity photograph of Marilyn Monroe in the film Niagara, which Warhol transformed with intentionally off-register printing and garish combinations of psychedelic colors. Daylight fluorescent colors, better known as Day-Glo colors, were invented in the 1930s, and by the 1960s had become integral to the graphic vocabulary of Pop art. While a conventional bright color reflects 80 to 90 percent of its color, a Day-Glo color appears to reflect more than 300 percent of its color. It is no wonder then that art historian Robert Rosenblum observed that Marilyn’s face “seems perpetually illuminated by the afterimage of a flashbulb.” With this method and presentation, Warhol and his work became synonymous with Pop Art.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/150050/marilyn-monroe-marilyn

In Rocky Coast, John Frederick Kensett depicted the shoreline on a hazy day, with calm water and gentle waves. The careful treatment of nature by the Hudson River School artists has been linked to the writings of Transcendentalists such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, who wrote in Nature (1836): “Standing on the bare ground,—my head bathed by the blithe air, and uplifted into infinite space,—all mean egotism vanishes. I become a transparent eye-ball. I am nothing.

The structure became famous for its many afterlives, first as a popular residential building in the heart of a Bronzeville, a prominent African American neighborhood in Chicago’s South Side, with a thriving jazz music scene in the 1920s. The building was immortalized by the song “Mecca Flat Blues” and later a poem “In the Mecca” by Gwendolyn Brooks from 1968. By the 1950s the aging Mecca Flats was home to a group of residents who fought to preserve it after the building was purchased by the Illinois Institute of Technology.

Embracing a modern depiction of the world with the full tonal range possible in photography, he co-founded Group f/64, named for the smallest aperture on a camera lens, which secured the sharpest focus. Adams, after consciously deciding to dedicate his career to photography in 1930, had already produced some of his most iconic images of nature by the time he made this still life. Not originally intended for publication, it served as an exercise in composition and application of available light sources, and as Adams noted, ultimately acted as a “pleasant reminder of an aesthetic experience.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/11360/still-life-san-francisco-california

A trip to a retail display manufacturer specializing in decorative objects inspired Wesselmann to have objects made in plastic from wooden molds and then painted and placed onto Formica shelves. Still Life #41 features both flat and dimensional objects. Removing identifying brands and labels, the artist emphasized the formal qualities of these purified, isolated shapes.

With more than 25,000 published photographs—including more than 1,000 magazine covers—Shay has shaped the way we see the world on the printed page.Born in the Bronx, Shay took up photography at the age of 12. He served in the U.S. Air Force in World War II, and his first published photographs—of an American military air disaster—were printed in a September 1944 issue of the weekly magazine Look. After the war, he joined Time and Life magazines, writing stories that he occasionally supplemented with his own (uncredited) images. In 1948 he moved to Chicago and took up photography full-time. In the nearly seven decades since, Shay’s camera has documented the famous and the downtrodden, the international and the local, the newsworthy and the intimate.Of particular significance in Shay’s career was his long friendship with the writer Nelson Algren (American, 1909–1981); the two met in 1949 and collaborated on several books and other projects. Together Shay and Algren roamed Chicago’s neighborhoods to document the lives and culture of the city’s down-and-out, and the photographer’s many pictures of the writer on those forays combine to form a multifaceted portrait.In his 1951 hymn to the city, Chicago: City on the Make, Nelson Algren compared his affection for his adopted home to loving a woman with a broken nose, writing, “you may find lovelier lovelies, but never a lovely so real.” Working in Chicago as a photojournalist since 1948, Art Shay befriended Algren while preparing a pitch for a story on the “prose poet of the Chicago slums” for Life magazine. For the next 15 years Shay documented Algren’s life in Chicago, in particular the neighborhood around the intersection of Damen Avenue and Division Street, where Algren lived and found inspiration for his writing. Here Shay captures Algren in front of the Polonia Bar, the opening location of his famous 1947 short story “How the Devil Came Down Division Street.”“Here Algren has just emerged from losing yet again in a Division Street poker game. In this game his dealer was the legendary dealer/heroin addict Bill Hackett. Algren’s favorite short story of his Chicago oeuvre was “How The Devil Came down Division Street.” It was a fanciful jaunt of a doomed immigrant alcoholic down a wild street in the Algrenian imagination. “Oncoming evenings” (as Algren called them) were always special for him as a writer. In his classic 1951 essay, Chicago: City on the Make, he limned “the great city’s night colors,” “its ceaseless dramas lived out behind blind doors, and the jargon-tongue of Chicago’s as spoken in our Saturday night dance halls, bookie joints and courts.”’—Art Shay",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/191353/nelson-algren-by-his-favorite-division-st-bar-chicago

There he became acquainted not only with Stieglitz’s atmospheric photographs, but also with those of Edward Steichen and others in their circle whose emotive pictures of clouds, rain, snow, and steam encouraged him to pay attention to observation under different environmental conditions, as explored in this sheet.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/2926/buildings-one-with-tower

In a South Carolina cotton mill, Hine discovered 48-inch-tall Sadie Pfeifer and photographed her directly next to the dangerous machinery that she faced each day. Though she is bathed in light, her small form is nearly overwhelmed by the rows of spools in front of her, their repeating forms evoking the monotonous, mechanical nature of factory work. Hine’s images originally appeared in periodicals, posters, and booths at anti-child labor conventions. In 1914, 35 states ruled to prohibit the employment of children under the age of 14 and to require an 8-hour workday for individuals under 16.

An homage to the domestic interiors of 17th–century Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer, Still Life with Mouse is one such early example of Penn’s interest in the still–life genre. Vogue art director Alexander Liberman asked Penn to compose “the most symbolic picture of a farm kitchen” for a January 1948 “farm” issue of House and Garden.

As the text is read horizontally, row by row, the progressive removal of one or more words from the topmost sentence produces an insistently non-narrative list of variations—even a kind of “poem.” The artist has said of this work, “What I was interested in was that art generally adds information to a situation, and it seems reasonable to also be able to remove information from a situation and get art from that.” Here, the permanence of inscribed steel is at odds with the shifting meanings of the sculpture’s series of statements.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/146916/second-poem-piece

When this drawing is viewed with other depictions of the barn, it is possible not only to reconstruct the building in the round, but also to understand Kahn’s perceptions of his surroundings and the different methods he used to explore them.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/73345/barn-in-blue-haze

The painting portrays William Rysdyk, a farm laborer in Chester, New York, standing next to his prized horse. Named Hambletonian, the colt became a celebrated racer and produced generations of winning horses, bringing wealth and fame to its owner. Portraits of Rysdyk and Hambletonian proliferated, some in oil and others as print reproductions. This composition is similar to several lithographs published in the 1860s and broadly circulated in 1876, the year of Hambletonian’s death.

Set among lush rolling meadows, the distant village of Montbarbin was rendered by staining wet paper with pale washes of green-gray and pink. The artist used stronger washes to suggest the contours of rocks and boulders in the foreground, and rapid brushstrokes to indicate the movement of air and clouds. Marin completed this watercolor by dabbing shapes in a darker gray wash on the left with a crumpled rag, approximating the fluttering leaves of a small tree. These untethered blots seem to be borne aloft by the energy of buffeting breezes.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/2919/spring-montbarbin

Throughout his career Warhol took tens of thousands of photographs with instant (Polaroid) cameras or point-and-shoot 35mm cameras, which became his preferred way to collect snippets of everyday encounters. From 1976 until his death in 1987, he enlisted his assistants to stitch together identical black-and-white photographs—grouped in grids of four, six, or twelve—with a sewing machine. In his silkscreen canvases of the 1960s, Warhol had employed repetition (for example, reproducing a glamour shot of Marilyn Monroe 25 times) yet he had made nearly every image slightly different, accentuating the “mistakes” of slippage, streaking, and blurring that are inherent to the silkscreen process. In these later stitched composites, by contrast, Warhol opted for an utterly impersonal sameness, perhaps to stress that the photograph—whether of an iconic subject or of something more banal—is an infinitely circulating image.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/121159/winston-man

usa_1588,Joseph Cornell,"Collage composed of cut and pasted, commercially printed papers, with graphite, on cardboard",Untitled (Satie and Ravel),"Cornell used photosets of a 1927 drawing by his beloved brother Robert in this and several other collages. Here he combined it with a reproduction of a note by Satie about Ravel who, Satie wrote, “assures me every time that I meet him, that he owes me a lot.” Robert, who suffered from a form of cerebral palsy, had died in 1965 at the age of fifty-four. A memorial exhibition of drawings by Robert and collages by Joseph had been held at Robert Schoelkopfs New York gallery in 1966. There is no reason to doubt the dates noted on the frame of the collage: Cornell refers on many occasions during this period to his brother Robert’s drawing of a rabbit, and also to Satie and Ravel. In February and March, when this collage was presumably begun, Cornell described its powerful emotional associations, linking it to music: “what seemed elusive, lost earlier—the way that Robert’s drawing … brought about this lovely business—bringing to life, bringing together Chabrier, S. Saens, Mme Manet (and by implication, Debussy) via the original drawing” (Cornell 1993, p. 390; entry for Feb. 23, 1968); in March he mentioned again “Carolyn‘s ‘Ravel Rabbit‘ par excellence Robert’s ‘Rabbit’” (Cornell 1993, p. 391; entry for March 10, 1968).Ravel was much in Cornell‘s mind at the time, perhaps partly because of an anecdote he mentioned in his diary: after the death of his mother, Ravel never returned to the apartment they had shared at 4, avenue Carnot. Cornell’s mother had died a year after Robert, in 1966, and his diary reveals how painful this double loss was. He addressed notes to his mother and on occasion heard Robert’s voice in the house. But he had by no means lost his avid curiosity and continued to work. Cornell had often worked listening to music—an important element in the complex associations he sought to instill in his boxes and collages. He became more reflective about his own working procedures toward the end of his life, commenting on the working procedures of artists and musicians he admired: “A musing: Erik Satie’s ‘hysterical’ obsessions with putting things to music. Ravel anecdote about Satie even wanting to put a menu to music” (Cornell 1993, p. 416).— Entry, Dawn Ades, Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1997, p. 94-95.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/107298/untitled-satie-and-ravel

usa_1602,Charles Ray,"16mm color film, silent, projector, pedestal, and seating; 12:30 min. From an unnumbered edition of four",Fashions,"Since the early 1970s, Los Angeles–based artist Charles Ray has produced sculptural works that disorient viewers and command space in unusual ways, exploring its aesthetic and psychological implications. Influenced in part by the simplicity, emotional blankness, and serial quality of Minimalism, Ray chooses subjects that may at first seem simple but, upon closer observation, reveal an ambitious combination of formalism and technical complexity. Viewers experience cognitive dissonance when encountering Ray’s works, which include life-size or larger than life-size mannequins and everyday objects. The artist’s hyperbolic presentation of the real, whether overexaggerated—or, as in Fashions, underexaggerated—turns the ordinary into the hallucinatory.In this, his only completed film, Ray shows his friend and former student Frances Stark, now a noted artist, modeling one hundred original outfits while rotating slowly on a small platform that he controlled. Standing in contrapposto, Stark attempts to mimic both the stoic pose of a classical statue and the stiffness of a modern commercial mannequin. However, her clearly visible tattoo, uneven tan lines, and blinking eyes signal that she is real. Given Ray’s ongoing quest to at once objectify the living and animate the lifeless, Fashions is unusual in that humanity prevails.As the title indicates, the focus is on the clothes, which Ray designed and then stapled or taped together. At the end of each rotation of the platform, the film cuts to a new ensemble, with absolutely no other action. As Ray described it, Stark becomes an “armature” on which to build his work, a means “to show off the labor.” Fashion is also used as a metaphor for identity; it can be interpreted differently depending on the beholder, fostering a false intimacy between the subject and viewer.Fashions combines the ideas appearing in Ray’s previous work with mannequins; his photographic piece All My Clothes (1973); and the sculptural Tabletop (1989), in which a bowl, potted plant, and other objects rotate slowly on a table. According to the artist, Fashions also recalls his sculptural piece Puzzle Bottle (1973), for which he sealed a scaled-down figure of himself in a bottle, forming an abstract space that exists outside of time. A film installation that should be viewed from beginning to end, Fashions is meant to be shown with a whirring, flickering 16mm film projector, a nearly outmoded format reminiscent of the ones used in Ray’s high school. The size, rotational speed, and mechanical movement of the film reel echoes that of Stark’s platform, collapsing the difference between the projector and the image it displays.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/184098/fashions

Katz begins his portraits with a series of preparatory sketches from life. In these sketches, Katz experiments with gesture and works out ideas for the finished composition. Katz then creates a small painting of the subject, consolidating the ideas he has explored in the previous sketches. A finished drawing in which the artist resolves all of the remaining compositional and lighting issues is made from the painted sketch and enlarged into a cartoon. The cartoon is transferred by poking holes along the lines of the drawing with a pouncing wheel. It is placed on the canvas, and dry pigment is pressed through the holes in the drawing, transferring the lines onto the canvas. Ultimately, because its composition is so carefully plotted out, the work has an intentionally limited sense of spontaneity.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/182606/red-coat

The photographs evoke the 8x10–inch film stills, or “glossies,“ taken by photographers on movie sets and used to promote Hollywood productions since the silent film era. In each photograph, Sherman poses as a star actress in an imaginary movie, deploying cinematic conventions like pose, lighting, and camera angle to imitate the look and feel of films from the 1950s and ’60s. Using carefully chosen costumes and settings, Sherman’s images draw attention to the construction of stereotypical female types in popular media. This photograph alternately depicts the objectified or vulnerable woman: Sherman’s rigid pose takes on the lifeless quality of a mannequin frozen in time, but also suggests a moment of suspense in which a startling event may take place at any second.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/212195/untitled-film-still-50

In Nauman’s earliest extant sculptures of 1965—a group of 11 elongated, vaguely anthropomorphic fiberglass works—he described his process as “making a mold, taking the two halves and putting them together to make a hollow shape and turning it inside out.” In these early pieces, the artist was testing the notion of sculpture as a medium of solid, durable forms, thus turning the assumptions of sculpture, as well as the form, inside out.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/52313/untitled
usa_1638,Joseph Cornell,"Commercially printed papers and gold appliques on untempered masonite, with coin and blue ink on glass, framed",Untitled (L’Abeille),"Cornell’s works sometimes gave the appearance, as in this case, of being wholly ready made. Only at second glance do they reveal his additions and alterations to the original found object. In Untitled (L’Abeille), the frame resembles the frames of his boxes, thereby suggesting a genre somewhere in between collage and construction. The blue staining that runs down the inside of the glass on each side of the text enhances its antique look, and the gold bees are added so subtly that they seem part of the fancy advertising for the company, L’Abeille, offering daily trips for English visitors in Belgium to Waterloo. The latter had become a tourist attraction, as the site of Napoleon’s defeat in 1812 at the hands of the English. Cornell may also have been attracted by the slight misprints on this notice (“THESE AND BACK,” for instance), which reinforce the idea of the foreign. A contemporary English audience would find a further oddity in this announcement, since it would immediately identify Waterloo as the London railway station. As indicated by the inscription on the back of this work, Cornell dedicated this collage to Jacques Brel (1929–1978), the French songwriter and singer, who became internationally known after 1957 and toured the United States in the 1960s.— Entry, Dawn Ades, Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1997, p. 90.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/99795/untitled-l-abeille

For the next three years, Wollaston worked in New York, executing numerous portraits for area sitters eager to acquire quality likenesses from a skilled, European-trained artist—a rarity in mid-18th-century America. Wollaston rendered his figures with convincing modeling and forms, excelling in the depiction of colorful draperies. In Portrait of a Young Man, as in his other works of the time, the artist employed formulaic poses, gestures, and dress, a result, in part, of looking to English sources for portraiture, but also a means of meeting the many requests for commissions. Beginning in 1753, Wollaston painted in Maryland, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and South Carolina.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/79768/portrait-of-a-young-man

Meanwhile, he undertook photographic studies of vernacular architecture on Martha’s Vineyard and in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. When he came to teach at Chicago’s Institute of Design in 1951 (where he remained for 20 years), he was thus perfectly suited to lead the Sullivan Project, a three-year, comprehensive documentation of the buildings in the city designed by the influential architect Louis Sullivan. In the 1950s, urban planners and developers across Chicago undertook massive demolition projects that brought down scores of Sullivan’s outstanding creations. Siskind photographed the Walker Warehouse, designed in 1886–89, just as it was being torn down, focusing on Sullivan’s elegant use of ornament even in utilitarian structures. Siskind’s picture emphasizes the shallowness of space and the play of light within the image’s rectangular boundaries.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/50919/walker-warehouse

For him, no medium is subsidiary to any other; all are expressions in different forms of the same ideas. Barney is, however, by far best known for his films. The five feature-length films of the Cremaster series comprise a gorgeous, absurdly complex epic. Purposely made out of sequence to discourage attempts at linear analysis and to emphasize the circular quality of the narrative, this densely interconnected project began with Cremaster 4 (1995, filmed on the Isle of Man, followed by Cremaster 1 (1996, filmed in Boise, Idaho), Cremaster 5 (1997, filmed in Budapest, Hungary), and Cremaster 2 (1999, filmed in and around the Great Salt Lake in Utah). The final film Cremaster 3 (2001, filmed mostly in New York City) is the longest and perhaps most crucial portion of the narrative. These four prints, which display characters, settings, and events from the end of the narrative, are not still images from the film. Rather, the photographs were posed separately from the filming and are presented together to connect and underscore particular scenes from the motion picture. These images center on the crown of the Chrysler Building turned into a maypole, and the Architect, Hiram Abiff (played by the artist Richard Serra), participating in a climactic rite that prematurely celebrates the building’s completion. The first and fourth images show workers festooning the crown with ribbons. The second shows Abiff at the center of a “maypole” dance. The third shows the unfinished building protruding into the sky in its quest to be the tallest structure in the city.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/180893/cremaster-3-the-dance-of-hiram-abiff

The artist wrote that Whitman “stands practically alone as one who has discovered a national soul and has given it expression in a form that can be called beautiful—that can be called art.” Regrettably, Storrs never found financial backing for his project.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/80465/winged-horse

A view of barges along the Seine River at the Petit Pont, the watercolor is crowned by gradually dissipating gray and purple storm clouds. Fragile beams of sunlight begin to break through, creating a mood balanced between ominous and hopeful. The artist harnessed his color palette to subtly communicate the feelings associated with a departing storm: touches of pink and yellow indicate that the worst is over, while darker and cooler washes capture the lingering aura of the deluge.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/65948/a-rolling-sky-paris-after-storm

The series of large-scale, richly saturated paintings combines appropriated portraits of actress Elizabeth Taylor (here, a shot of her as Cleopatra, taken by Bert Stern for Vogue magazine in 1962) with profane language, shattering both female stereotypes and conventions of representation. Taylor was a controversial feminist figure throughout her career, conveying equal parts bravura, sexual power, and vulnerability.

He started by inserting fragments of poems into his paintings, as, for example, in We Two Boys Together Clinging (1961), which integrates two lines from a Walt Whitman poem of the same title. Fifteen years later, inspired by Wallace Stevens’s “The Man with the Blue Guitar” (1937), with its themes of representation and imaginative transformation, Hockney made 10 drawings in colored inks and crayons. With the aid of master printer Aldo Crommelynck those drawings were converted into 20 mixed intaglio prints using a color-etching process initially developed for Pablo Picasso.While not a literal illustration of Stevens’s poem, the print series The Blue Guitar interprets its themes in visual terms, and most of the images show Hockney’s love of Picasso. The print Old Guitarist juxtaposes the Art Institute’s famous painting of 1903–04 (1926.253) with later Picasso iconography. Other sheets likewise contrast Picasso’s different phases within the same image; throughout the series, Hockney distinguishes the disparate styles by using different colors.It is perhaps Hockney’s Blue Guitar that has perpetuated the idea that Wallace Stevens was similarly inspired by Picasso’s Old Guitarist. Although Stevens was familiar with modern art and no doubt saw the painting when it was exhibited at the Wadsworth Atheneum in 1934, he insisted that no one picture inspired his famous poem.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/131317/what-is-this-picasso-from-the-blue-guitar

Both pastels retain their original Rococo-style frames. They may have been carved by the Boston cratsman John Welch, who created many of Copley’s Rococo frames, the type the artist used most frequently for his American portraits. The frame on Mrs. Henry Hill was gilded, as this was generally appropriate for the Rococo style; however, recent scholarship has revealed that a few Copley frames, like that of Henry Hill, were painted black.

He photographed incessantly and swiftly, claiming, “I photograph to find out what something will look like photographed.” This image was selected by John Szarkowski, then curator of photography at the Museum of Modern Art, as part of Women Are Beautiful, a 1975 portfolio of 85 images of women taken by Winogrand over a number of years.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/129987/world-s-fair-new-york-city

Together they gathered a group of 20 Jewish professionals to purchase To the Dance for the museum.

Callahan built a body of work that was at once humanistic and restlessly experimental, ever pushing the boundaries of photographic conventions and materials. Callahan often set himself a challenge within strict technical or formal parameters—photographing, for example, female pedestrians on the street from a particular distance, or his wife and daughter in a series of posed 8 x 10–inch “snapshots.” In 1956–57 he experimented with collage, cutting up pieces of paper and fashion and advertising photographs, arranging them like a jigsaw puzzle in his studio, and photographing them as one would a still life. Callahan produced the collages in black and white and in color; the numerous faces and hands in this color composition give an impression of a mass of flesh.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/118836/collage

usa_1733,Max Ernst,"Oil and sand on linen mounted on Masonite pressed-wood board, with cork frame by the artist",Untitled (Birds),"This work belongs to a group of paintings of birds, most of which were made between 1924 and 1920, according to Spies (Ernst Katalog/, vol. 2, 1975 pp. 381-91, nos. 728-50, ills.; vol. 3, 1976, p. 131, nos. 1044-45. ills.). Dated by Spies to 1924 (ibid., vol. 2, 1975. p. 381, no. 730, ill.), this work is especially close to Ernst’s Birds, also of 1924, and Two Birds of around 1925 (ibid., vol. 2, 1975, pp. 385-86 nos. 738, 740, ills.), all three of which were given very similar cork frames by the artist. Although these works are generally thought to be executed on sandpaper, in this case at least, as Cynthia Kuniej Berry has observed, “close examination of the unframed painting reveals otherwise” (see Cynthia Kuniej Berry, Examination Report, August 27, 1993, in curatorial files). In her report, the painting is described as “executed on a fine lightweight, plain weave linen,” on which the paint was “generously applied with active brushwork in textured, opaque masses with thick impasto,” while ‘the remainder of the surface is covered with a thin, even layer of sand” (ibid.). Ernst indeed applied paint thickly to create the forms of the birds and then scraped through to reveal colored layers below, employing what he called his grattage technique. The ribbed flecks of brown and black paint skillfully connote feathers. The circular heads of the birds appear in many of Ernst’s works from the period, such as 100,000 Doves (1926, Paris, private collection; Ernst Katalog, vol. 3, 1976, p. 121, no. 1025, ill.), in which the circular form also is transformed into an eye or a breast. The undulation of the picture’s surface seems intrinsic to the work and gives the effect of a relief, although it may have also resulted from environmental changes (see Kuniej Berry 1993 above). Ernst used similar carved cork frame, often with varying designs, in other works of the same subject (Ernst Katalog, vol. 2, 1975, pp. 385-91 nos. 738-40, 744-46, 749, 751, ills.; vol. 3, 1976, pp. 131, 136, nos. 1045, 1055, ills.).— Entry, Dawn Ades, Surrealist Art: The Lindy and Edwin Bergman Collection at the Art Institute of Chicago, 1997, p. 126.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/118687/untitled-birds
usa_1734,James Turrell,Wood framing and sheetrock,Rayna,"A pioneer of the California Light and Space movement of the 1960s, Turrell builds environments that invite viewers to experience “the material of light through the medium of perception.” Rayna is from James Turrell’s early series of Space-Division constructions, which he began in 1976. In these works, a pivotal but initially elusive aperture divides a single room into two separate components—an outer viewing room and an inner “sensing” space. Viewers enter the dimly lit outer room through a dark corridor, seeing first what appears to be a flat, rectangular panel hanging on the far wall. As one approaches, the rectangle grows increasingly pronounced until, up close, it reveals itself to open onto a space beyond that seems filled by an almost tangible mist of light. The rectangular opening can be perceived by the viewer in two ways: as a wafer thin plane of light suspended in space and as infinite space. Both perceptual phenomena are based on the reception of light on the retina, to which Turrell attaches a mystical or, at least, otherworldly interpretation. He once referred to the resulting effect as “looking-at-the-space-looking-at-you.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/64456/rayna

The resulting images transcend pure documentation. Her appropriation of works in situ addresses the broader social and economic issues that structure modes of presentation. These early photographs, often displayed as a triptych, deal with the theme of monogramming and, by extension, personal vanity. Depicting a couch with a Lacoste emblem, Alligator draws our attention to the Donald Judd sculpture above it and the reflection of the artist in its surface. Untitled shows a Jasper Johns painting, visible through the clear glass of a vitrine that exhibits Robert Rauschenberg’s oddly titled Monogram (1955–59; Moderna Museet, Stockholm). Lastly, Monogram depicts Johns’s White Flag (1955; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) hanging over a bed with a duvet lavishly embroidered with the owner’s initials. This sequence shows that Lawler is constantly making connections between various categories of signs, curatorial concerns of private collectors and museums, and the questions raised by redisplaying these pieces as the subject matter of “original” works of art.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/187166/alligator

Separated into three distinct parts and reassembled with wood trowels and metal nails that pierce and adorn its body and face, the limbless form precariously balances a narrow sheet of glass topped with a three-dimensional charcoal drawing. Alchemy of Pain references the exaggerated poses of classical sculpture while revealing the allegorical transformation of everyday materials into a symbol of awkward harmony.Matthew Monahan assembles freestanding, semi-figurative sculptures, presented in glass vitrines or on handcrafted pedestals, from unconventional, disparate materials such as floral foam, beeswax, glitter, pins, Styrofoam, glass, twine, wire, metal leaf, and fragments of his earlier works. Under self-imposed rules, Monahan creates by mining his imagination, without the use of photography, source materials, fabrications, or ready-mades. His fragmented figures often depict characters—warriors, saints, slain heroes, and demons— that express such enigmatic emotions as Zen contemplation and Gothic anguish. Monahan’s complex layering of narratives onto materials invites speculation as to each object’s history and meaning.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/193901/alchemy-of-pain

Using his camera’s shutter as a trap, diCorcia captured seemingly banal, fleeting moments between strangers on the street. A final addition to Streetwork, Havana is one of 10 photographs that di Corcia took from a single vantage point in this manner, not knowing the situations that might materialize in front of his theatrical lighting. The mute presence of this man pausing on a sidewalk could be interpreted as either inquisitive or predatorial when considered in relation to the two young women at the counter nearby—although diCorcia insists in the “non-narrative” quality of his work.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/195708/%E6%85%88%E6%85%B6%E6%85%AE

Bishop’s abstraction is grounded by oblique references to geometry, grids, and architectural structures. In the mid-1960s, he began pouring thinned oil paint onto his canvases and tilting them to layer color without a paintbrush, often leaving areas of white, primed canvas visible to balance such applications of color.

A global itinerant, he lives and works all over the world—predominantly in Berlin and formerly in Paris and his native Tirana. The artist’s short, formally accomplished works poignantly and strategically blend documentary, narrative, and autobiographical approaches, existing as minimal, ab-stract allegories of cultural suspension and transition. Concerns of immigration, exile, social alienation, violence, crime, poverty, and repression shadow all of his poetic, melancholic compositions.Sala’s work is rooted in part in Albanian culture and history. He grew up under one of the most repressive communist dictatorships in Europe and later witnessed the tentative transition to a democratic, market-driven system before leaving to study in France in 1996. The following year, the Albanian economy collapsed under the weight of a corrupt government, bringing widespread lawlessness and violent unrest. Sala’s intensely analytical perspective has been forged by this firsthand experience of social turbulence and radical change. Confronting a traumatic history while negotiating a diasporic present, his work describes a condition of simultaneous disorientations—temporal, spatial, visual, aural, and linguistic.Blindfold, like Sala’s work in general, displays an acute political consciousness. The two-channel projection depicts a blinding sun. Shown both at sunrise and sunset, it reflects off a pair of new, as-yet-unused metal billboards in Tirana, a city that figures prominently in many of Sala’s mature experiments. The radiant blankness of the two boards, which appear as surrogate cinema screens, suggests the incipient, fragile nature of Albania’s transition to a capitalist economy. The infrastructure of shiny public advertising coexists incongruously with the city’s decrepit surroundings.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/184190/blindfold

usa_1766,Bob Snyder,"Color video, sound; 10 min.",Lines of Force,"In over three decades of work, Bob Snyder has combined synthesized sound and visual imagery to great effect. He played an integral role in developing the Sound Art Department at the School of the Art Institute, where he has been a faculty member since 1974. While formally trained in music and composition, Snyder originally had ambitions as a painter and always maintained a strong interest in visual representation. His early experiments with oscilloscopes—which he used to visualize sound waves and accompany his musical compositions—naturally led him to video technology, which afforded further opportunities to blend the visual and the aural in innovative ways. Among the original collaborators with Dan Sandin at University of Illinois-Chicago’s Circle Graphics Habitat, Snyder was in the vanguard of formal video investigations with the Sandin Image Processor and other experimental equipment.Modulating between abstract and representational images, Lines of Force uses found footage from a variety of sources, including a classified weapons testing film produced by the United States Army, segments from the 1973 movie Psychomania, and various selections from broadcast television.

Blume, a recent icon in Lawler’s oeuvre, documents a Jeff Koons sculpture on display at Galerie Max Hetzler’s booth at Art Basel in 2003. Due to its highly reflective surface, the artwork becomes a vehicle for advertising other objects for sale; like the artist, it reflects and records the installation of surrounding art.

When they approach me they see only my surroundings, themselves, or figments of their imagination—indeed, everything and anything except me.—Ralph Ellison, Invisible Man, 1952By 1952 Gordon Parks had cemented his reputation as a successful photojournalist by becoming the first African American staff photographer at Life magazine. Ralph Ellison had just published his first and only finished novel, Invisible Man, regarded today as one of the most important American novels of the postwar period. That same year, these two artists and friends undertook the second of two magazine collaborations: a photo-essay for the August 25, 1952, issue of Life that introduced Ellison’s novel and titled “A Man Becomes Invisible.” These collaborations aimed to bring to national consciousness the black experience in postwar America, with Harlem as its nerve center.Written in the first person, Invisible Man recounts the journey of an unnamed black protagonist from the Deep South to Harlem. It is also a stark account of America’s racial divisions and of the narrator’s awakening to his condition of invisibility within the surrounding cultures of white and black alike—a realization that no one can see beyond what is projected onto the color of his skin.Within months of the novel’s publication, Parks and Ellison collaborated on “A Man Becomes Invisible”—although the level of Ellison’s involvement remains unclear. Parks set out to create photographs that illustrate Ellison’s text, depicting many of the novel’s key Harlem scenes: the protagonist’s brightly lit underground home, his rousing street speeches, the climactic accounts of the Harlem riots, and the iconic portrayal of the protagonist ending his hibernation and emerging aboveground. The resulting images are strikingly varied, including street photography, staged images shot in elaborately constructed sets, and surreal photomontages. They hew to Ellison’s prose style, which collapses distinctions between realism and fantasy. But the depictions are true not just to Ellison’s words but also to the emotions underlying them. Only four of these photographs were ever published in Life, but the dozens of surviving prints and contact sheets in Parks’s archive point to a larger, unrealized project.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/223896/the-invisible-man-harlem-new-york-from-the-series-a-man-becomes-invisible-1952

usa_1796,Alexander Hesler,Platinum print,"Abraham Lincoln, Springfield, Illinois","Alexander Hesler, a noted commercial photographer based in Chicago, arranged two portrait sessions with Lincoln, in 1858 and 1860. The images from their first session displayed the presidential candidate with disordered and messy hair. During the subsequent election campaign, the Republican National Committee grew concerned that Lincoln might appear unkempt compared to his opponent, Stephen A. Douglas. Hesler therefore produced this more dapper and well-groomed representation of the candidate at the second sitting, and these and similar portraits by Mathew Brady were widely distributed as badges. In this first presidential campaign to employ photographs, the decision to make Lincoln a familiar face may well have swayed voters. The artist George B. Ayers purchased Hesler’s studio in 1867, a move that saved its contents from being destroyed when the gallery burned down in the Chicago Fire of 1871. Ayers later reprinted Hesler’s glass plate negatives, claiming this image in particular as the “Original and Best Picture of Abraham Lincoln,” essential for any collector of portraits or Lincoln memorabilia.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/49356/abraham-lincoln-springfield-illinois

This work extended to his collaborations with his wife, Sylvia (Laini) Abernathy, with whom he designed album covers for Delmark Records in the 1960s. Around that time, the poet and author Amiri Baraka (born LeRoi Jones) encountered Fundi’s photographs of Chicago and proposed a book project that would combine his poetry with Fundi’s images. The resulting collaboration, In Our Terribleness (Some Elements and Meaning in Black Style), designed by Laini and published in 1970, is both a statement about Black aesthetics and a call to action by the Black Power movement. As Baraka proclaimed, “Our terribleness is our survival as beautiful beings, anywhere.” The Screen and Mother’s Day both appeared in In Our Terribleness. In 1971 the New York Times hailed the book as “an example of the new direction that black art is taking.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/125545/the-screen-from-the-series-born-hip

He produced some five thousand images of deplorable working and living conditions for children—some just four or five years old—in coal mines, cotton mills, canneries, and farms, sometimes posing as a fire inspector or postcard salesman to gain access. Hine composed his images to elicit sympathy from viewers, adding captions noting his subjects’ ages, heights, or work histories. Interested in art as a means to enhance persuasion and critical thinking rather than to create things of rarefied beauty, Hine distributed his photographs in reformist or popular magazines; they were also made into graphic posters and employed as lantern slides in lectures. It was relatively hard to inspire compassion for those in the “street trades,” especially newspaper delivery boys (newsies), whom contemporary literature both valorized and sentimentalized. The committee, however, demonstrated that in no other occupation were children so unsupervised and that the harsh city environment exposed them to physical danger and adult vices. The young boys seen here, smoking like their elders, seem prematurely hardened to life on the street.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/47094/newsies-at-skeeter-branch-st-louis-missouri-11-00-a-m

Unlike other period references to the minimal home, Fuller’s idea was less related to space than to efficiency. In the hopes of obtaining “the maximum gain” from the minimum use of material and energy, the Dymaxion was modeled on the streamlined factory production of the automobile. This simplification extended to a centralized core housing that held all mechanical equipment while providing structural support for the mast-hung, lightweight hexagonal building. Although this design was never realized, Fuller included many of the innovative aspects of his Dymaxion House into his aluminum-clad Wichita house or Dymaxion Dwelling Machine, which was produced as a prototype in 1948.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/76425/a-minimum-dymaxion-home-elevation

He started by inserting fragments of poems into his paintings, as, for example, in We Two Boys Together Clinging (1961), which integrates two lines from a Walt Whitman poem of the same title. Fifteen years later, inspired by Wallace Stevens’s “The Man with the Blue Guitar” (1937), with its themes of representation and imaginative transformation, Hockney made 10 drawings in colored inks and crayons. With the aid of master printer Aldo Crommelynck those drawings were converted into 20 mixed intaglio prints using a color-etching process initially developed for Pablo Picasso.While not a literal illustration of Stevens’s poem, the print series The Blue Guitar interprets its themes in visual terms, and most of the images show Hockney’s love of Picasso. The print Old Guitarist juxtaposes the Art Institute’s famous painting of 1903–04 (1926.253) with later Picasso iconography. Other sheets likewise contrast Picasso’s different phases within the same image; throughout the series, Hockney distinguishes the disparate styles by using different colors.It is perhaps Hockney’s Blue Guitar that has perpetuated the idea that Wallace Stevens was similarly inspired by Picasso’s Old Guitarist. Although Stevens was familiar with modern art and no doubt saw the painting when it was exhibited at the Wadsworth Atheneum in 1934, he insisted that no one picture inspired his famous poem.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/131309/a-picture-of-ourselves-from-the-blue-guitar

Puryear first read Cane while he was teaching at Fisk University, in Nashville, his first experience living in the south. He said that he related to the point of view of a visitor “looking at what so defines blackness in America, the agricultural life of the South, the sharecropping that had grown out of slavery.” In the late 1990s Puryear was asked to contribute illustrations to a new edition of the book. About his work for the project, Puryear has commented:The overriding issue was to work in a two-dimensional medium. To make flat images is such a departure from what I do as a sculptor. I had seldom made woodcuts since my student days. The challenge was to create a set of images that would relate together in a familial way, suggestive of the narrative but not overtly so.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/158963/avey-from-cane

There he joined a group of African American expatriates, including Richard Wright and James Baldwin, and embraced abstraction, producing works that explore different effects of color and light. This composition features a vibrant yellow palette typical of Delaney’s work; yellow was his preferred hue, and it carried associations with the sun and held a personal, spiritual significance. Interweaving the yellow with green and orange pigments, he created a lyrical, tapestry-like effect of layered brushwork.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/117189/untitled

usa_1863,John Angus Chamberlain,Urethane foam and cord,Untitled,"Though he worked in a variety of media, John Chamberlain is best known for abstract sculptures and installations of painted, compressed automotive parts, which he began in the 1950s. Frustrated with misinterpretations of his work as depictions of car wrecks or evocations of violence, Chamberlain departed from his signature motif in 1966. From this point until 1973, he fabricated sculptures almost exclusively from urethane foam. Chamberlain incorporated his distinct style of crushing and wadding as he tied pieces of the foam together with string or cords. Untitled is one of Chamberlain’s early, midsized foam works.

The Desert Cantos examines the places where civilization runs up against nature, with often-disastrous effects on the land. One section focuses on two Playboy magazines Misrach found near the Nevada Nuclear Test Site, propped up against a gutted television and used for shooting practice by locals. Although the women on the covers had been the intended targets, Misrach realized that the bullets had pierced many aspects of contemporary culture: not only centerfold models but also political figures like Oliver North and Gloria Steinem; celebrities such as Madonna, Ray Charles, and Dennis Quaid; advertisements for alcohol, cigarettes, and shampoo; and, as shown here, art-world personalities like Andy Warhol. Such imagery becomes, in Misrach’s enlarged photographs, emblematic of an American culture riddled with violence.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/121139/playboy-38

usa_1871,Sherrie Levine,Casein on mahogany panel,Untitled (Check 2),"Sherrie Levine first gained widespread critical recognition in the early 1980s for her photographic re-creations of famous works of art, typically by men, through which she questioned the ideals of high modernism and confronted issues of authorship, repetition, and authenticity. Although known for these works, which redefined the role of appropriation strategies, Levine’s concerns are never specific to any media; sculpture, drawing, and painting have always been a part of her practice. Later in her career, she began to make works inspired by the precedent of a generic type, rather than a particular work of art. Her series of stripe paintings, for example, refers to both Russian Suprematist painting of the first part of the 20th century and American Minimal painting of the 1960s. Untitled (Check 2) is from a series of game-board motifs, marking the first time Levine drew source material from outside the art-historical realm.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/146913/untitled-check-2

usa_1873,David Hockney,Color etching and aquatint from two copper plates on white wove paper,"Figures with Still Life, from The Blue Guitar","Since the early 1960s, David Hockney has sought ways to meld his modern aesthetic style with highly personalized subject matter. He started by inserting fragments of poems into his paintings, as, for example, in We Two Boys Together Clinging (1961), which integrates two lines from a Walt Whitman poem of the same title. Fifteen years later, inspired by Wallace Stevens’s “The Man with the Blue Guitar” (1937), with its themes of representation and imaginative transformation, Hockney made 10 drawings in colored inks and crayons. With the aid of master printer Aldo Crommelynck those drawings were converted into 20 mixed intaglio prints using a color-etching process initially developed for Pablo Picasso.While not a literal illustration of Stevens’s poem, the print series The Blue Guitar interprets its themes in visual terms, and most of the images show Hockney’s love of Picasso. The print Old Guitarist juxtaposes the Art Institute’s famous painting of 1903–04 (1926.253) with later Picasso iconography. Other sheets likewise contrast Picasso’s different phases within the same image; throughout the series, Hockney distinguishes the disparate styles by using different colors.It is perhaps Hockney’s Blue Guitar that has perpetuated the idea that Wallace Stevens was similarly inspired by Picasso’s Old Guitarist. Although Stevens was familiar with modern art and no doubt saw the painting when it was exhibited at the Wadsworth Atheneum in 1934, he insisted that no one picture inspired his famous poem.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/131307/figures-with-still-life-from-the-blue-guitar

Yet as the flames died, resolve replaced despair. This photograph was made perhaps one month after the fire, and it shows the makeshift homes, businesses, telegraph poles, and streetcar tracks that were in place even before the rubble was pushed into the lake. Within three years, Chicago would regain its position as the premier city of the Midwest.This panorama was probably made by George N. Barnard, who documented the tremendous devastation of the South by the campaign of General William Tecumseh Sherman during the Civil War. Barnard had a studio in downtown Chicago, but, forced into the lake to flee the fire, he lost everything except the equipment he held aloft in the water.

After the war, in 1865, he published Gardner’s Photographic Sketch Book of the War, two volumes of 50 prints each accompanied by floridly written descriptions of the scenes he and his photographic staff had witnessed. At Gettysburg—one of the deadliest battles, and a turning point in the conflict—he made the now iconic photograph of a Confederate sharpshooter in his final resting place. In recent years this picture has invited controversy, as historians have argued that Gardner and his assistants, wishing to heighten the impact of the image, moved the corpse, also seen in another photograph in the Sketch Book, and that the gun was in fact the photographer’s and not the soldier’s.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/196395/home-of-a-rebel-sharpshooter-gettysburg

After working on experimental plans for a High-Rise City (Hochhausstadt) in the 1920s, Hilberseimer shifted the scale of his planning studies to focus on the settlement unit, a new type of urban development based on low-rise houses. The settlement unit was a residential group whose size was controlled to allow inhabitants to travel to work on foot, thus mediating between the scale of the city and the needs of the individual house. Hilberseimer modeled his settlement unit on a pattern of small, attached, L-shaped houses in long rows designed to maximize privacy at a relatively high density and to promote a fruitful repetition and standardization.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/102072/settlement-units-density-studies-aerial-perspective

In 1951, shortly after undergoing Freudian psychoanalysis, he began the series In Search of Myself, which captured anonymous shoppers on Chicago’s State Street as a means to explore the relationship between identity and consumerism.

The trauma of separation from her family, culture, and homeland became the bedrock of the artist’s practice, which was rooted in physical and spiritual connections between the body and the natural world. The Silueta series—hundreds of earth-body sculptures and their attendant photographs and films—constitutes the core of Mendieta’s project. Based initially on the artist’s own body and silhouette, the Siluetas developed into a panopoly of archetypal goddess figures and eventually more universal human forms. They also incorporated a unique blend of ritual effects drawn from diverse religious practices in much the same way as studio performances Untitled (Body Tracks) and Untitled (Blood Sign #1), in which she used animal blood. An intensely productive period of travel to Cuba, where Mendieta felt her practice was reconnected with its origins, promoted these and other drawings, etching, and sculptures in which, for the first, her iconic goddess forms became permanent individual objects.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/209980/blood-sign

Diana then proved so popular that he produced numerous reduced-sized replicas in bronze for American patrons. True to the Beaux-Arts ideals then current in France, MacMonnies included traditional symbols of the goddess such as the bow in her hand and the crescent moon in her hair, recalling classical precedent. However, his naturalistic rendering of the nude female figure, modeled from life, has a lively grace that marks MacMonnies’s independence from strict neoclassical tradition.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/107051/diana

This photograph of a Nativity scene bolstered her reputation as a photographer: Stieglitz published it in his early journal Camera Notes and again in the opening issue of Camera Work, in which Käsebier was the featured artist. With its soft focus, rich tonality, deep emotional overtones, and classical source material, The Manger epitomizes the pictorialist aesthetic cultivated by fine art photographers of the period. Käsebier was praised for her heartfelt images of mothers and children, in which she created the appearance of unposed authenticity even with staged subjects.

Yet at the same time that Stieglitz was exploring modern art, he was also looking back to the 19th-century photographs of David Octavius Hill. He wrote to R. Child Bayley around that time, “I have done quite some photography recently. It is intensely direct. Portraits. Buildings from my back window at 291, a whole series of them, a few landscapes and interiors. All interrelated.

Though he never saw war firsthand, Bellows’s engagement with the subject grew from documentary reports on the atrocities reported in the American press. Reportedly, this image and the one that accompanies it, Bacchanale, were both based on eyewitness accounts from the 1915 Bryce Report, which recorded hundreds of stories of the German invasion of Belgium in August 1914. The testimonies published in the Bryce Report’s 320-page Appendix A included some sensationalist accounts of mutilations and rapes for which there is no other evidence. The series War, which chronicled these crimes, consisted of 5 oil paintings, 20 lithographic prints, and more than 30 related drawings. In this image, the sharp Picklehauben helmets, heavy uniforms, and gleaming bayonet contrast with the soft vulnerability of exposed human flesh. The exaggeratedly large arms and hands of the victims, which are raised to the sky, call attention to their subjugation and acquiescence.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/73307/barricade

Trouble belongs to a series of paintings of pointedly four-letter words, such as fear, riot, and amok, in which Wool stacked the letters two by two. Here the vowels have been deleted, shortening trouble to optimize its graphic, visual impact. Wool’s paintings are typically black-and-white; this variation is thus unique within the artist’s practice.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/198567/trouble

He later described the moment when, desperate to escape the stuffy upper classes, he looked down to the steerage level: “I saw shapes related to each other. I saw a picture of shapes and underlying that the feeling I had about life.”For more on the Alfred Stieglitz collection at the Art Institute, along with in-depth object information, please visit the website: The Alfred Stieglitz Collection.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/66309/the-steerage

The artist stated: “Some Thames is literally the idea of a finite thing having an infinite range of appearance or expression because of its inseparable relation to other things.” The Thames—alternately transparent and opaque, violent and still, pastoral and urban, cleansing and dirty—offers a range of broad metaphors for an understanding of self. Some Thames, like most of Horn’s work, is an abstracted self-portrait.

Because Marian’s death was a suicide and the couple was fascinated by Asian cultures, Henry asked Saint-Gaudens to avoid Christian symbolism and instead evoke the “contemplative compassion derived from Buddhist philosophy.” When Chicago architect Daniel Burnham visited Saint-Gaudens in 1892, he saw a plaster cast of the figure’s head and was enthralled by its mysterious yet meditative quality. In 1893, perhaps in celebration of Chicago’s World’s Columbian Exposition, Saint-Gaudens gave the bust to Burnham, who later had four bronzes cast from it.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/191184/bust-from-the-adams-memorial

Among the most celebrated watercolorists working today, Nilsson builds her compositions by applying thin layers of transparent wash, resulting in great depth and brilliant colors.

A particularly gnarled, distorted tree moves with the frenetic energy of a dancer, while its companions rattle and sway in the breeze. Marin combined his hieroglyphic mark making with a carefully orchestrated color palette: rays of yellow sun warm the horizon, while touches of bright red-orange lead the eye into space. Again defying tradition, he used charcoal wash to darken and muddy the red tones of the clustered trees in the middle ground. He painted over heavy charcoal lines, smearing the particles to create a dark haze. Juxtaposing complexity of line with an unusually direct application of color, the artist captured a sensation of life in motion that is joyful, almost spiritual.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/65972/tree-and-sea-maine

This approach, which left plenty of space around the sheet, emphasizes the artwork’s materiality, an important concept for Marin. Unlike the white enamel frames he had favored throughout the previous decade, his gilded mounts and frames of the early 1920s were not intended to harmonize with his art. Rather, the use of gold was meant to be visually jarring, here drawing the viewer into the violent sea and proving the strength of the composition.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/65975/the-green-sea-movement-stonington-maine

Not the famous and the well known, but the unknown and the unnamed, thus revealing the roots from which springs the greatness of all human beings.” In pursuit of this goal, DeCarava frequently photographed people during their commute in New York City’s subway stations. Here, however, he presented an ambiguous moment: a man rests on the subway steps, suggesting vagrancy, a fall, or some other unknown circumstance. DeCarava increased the illegibility of the image by shooting from an odd vantage point and—as was his preference—by using only the limited available light, lending the scene an eerie, shadowy cast.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/73909/man-lying-down-subway-steps

In the late 1960s he made a major aesthetic shift by transitioning from images of life on the streets captured with a handheld camera to studies of the American landscape taken with a large-format view camera. In 1978 a Guggenheim grant allowed Sternfeld to embark on a nearly decade-long project that began as a drive across the United States. His photographic Wanderjahr, which echoed those of Walker Evans in the 1930s and Robert Frank in the 1950s, yielded the 1987 publication American Prospects, the contents of which the Art Institute owns in its entirety. After a Flash Flood, Rancho Mirage, California, July 1979 is typical of photographs in that book, many replete with details that take time to register fully, such as the comparison between a more visible car that sits calmly parked and another, destroyed, that lies overturned and embedded in the underside of a largely beige-to-brown landscape. Sternfeld uses color here and often to add layers of emotional complexity to seemingly straightforward images.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/127872/after-a-flash-flood-rancho-mirage-california-july-1979-from-the-series-american-prospects

This photograph of the interior of a church was made on a visit to Tepotzotlán during Holy Week in April 1924. In his Daybooks, Weston noted Modotti’s satisfaction with the pictures she made there, especially her “abstraction done in the tower”: “She is very happy over it and well she may be,” he wrote. “I, myself, would be pleased to have done it.” Modotti heightened the ambiguity of this already abstract composition by printing it with the platinum process, which registers subtle gradations of tone.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/120096/interior-of-church-tepotzotlan-mexico

usa_2136,Jim Isermann,Hand-loomed cotton and foam,Untitled (Cubeweave),"Favoring household materials and self-taught techniques, California-based Jim Isermann resituates retro designs and handcrafted processes within the realm of fine art. While Isermann’s early work directly confronts the 1950s appropriation of the oeuvres of artists such as Jean Arp, Alexander Calder, and Joan Miró for commercial design, his mature projects engage the exchange between high and low culture in more subtle ways by reinterpreting the agendas of Pop Art, Op Art, and Minimalism for the needs of contemporary design. Untitled (Cubeweave), a work of singular importance in Isermann’s career, belongs to a series of textile cube pieces. An outer fabric, meticulously handwoven by the artist, tightly encases an underlying structure of foam. Although the cubic form speaks directly to Minimalism, the irresistible sensual effects and everyday technique used in this work evoke vernacular objects and spaces, entirely recontextualizing the sculpture.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/197561/untitled-cubeweave
usa_2137,Iñigo Manglano-Ovalle,"Compact disc, blue tinted polyester window film, existing architectural space; 13 min. loop",Sonambulo II (Blue),"Iñigo Manglano-Ovalle first gained international recognition for a diverse body of work––consisting of both studio-based objects and activist-inspired public art—that blended contemporary urban culture with poetic meditations on aesthetics, nature, and beauty. Sonambulo II (Blue) speaks precisely to the crucial intersection between his earlier street-based endeavors and his later, more gallery-bound practice. Importantly, it exists as both an individual work of sound art and a site-specific installation commissioned by the Art Institute.Consisting mainly of the soothing sounds of a summer thunder- and rainstorm, the audio portion mimics a New Age relaxation tape or therapeutic sleep aid. The origins of the work, however, are quite different: the audio was composed from the sound of a single gunshot that the artist sampled and digitally remastered using state-of-the-art computer editing equipment. The sound loop begins with the explosion of the gunshot, which is followed by eight seconds of tense silence. The gunshot sound is then repeated 385,000 times and seamlessly blended with the beginnings of the simulated thunder. The rainstorm effect follows, and the piece automatically repeats.The conceptual roots of the work can be found in Manglano-Ovalle’s biography. An insomniac, he decided to construct his own relaxation tape directly from the very street noises that were contributing to his sleeplessness. Placing a microphone outside his bedroom window on Chicago’s Northwest Side, he captured the sound of gunfire in a single night. In a poignant act of creative transformation, the artist constructed an escape based in reality, turning the potentially frightening sounds of violence into a soothing means of respite. Sound itself, however, is also a major focus of his thinking: “I don’t use sound in a linear, time-based way. To me sound is very much an extension of sculpture. It has physical form to me. It drives and also occupies space.”Sonambulo II (Blue) is much more than a personal lullaby: Manglano-Ovalle’s strikingly inventive manipulations contain a compelling social critique. The references to sleep introduce the metaphor of unconsciousness and consciousness. Extending these into the arena of pressing political issues such as gun violence, the work points to the basic differences between awareness and ignorance, social action and neglect. The piece masks the sounds of gunfire with the effect of a natural phenomenon; in doing so, it suggests the ways in which violence and fear too often become the ambient backdrop of contemporary urban life.In the Art Institute’s 1999 installation, shown here, viewers were invited to expe-rience the work’s artificial nature while contemplating the actual urban landscape, which was beautifully framed by a wall of tall glass windows in the museum’s Rice Loggia. Hermetically insulated from the exigencies of day-to-day street life, visitors were actually suspended above the cityscape. This artifice, further heightened by the blue tint of the windows, created the effect of imitation rain meeting imitation sky.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/152431/sonambulo-ii-blue
usa_2138,Stuart Davis,Gouache with graphite on off-white wove paper,Detail Study #1 for “Package Deal”,"Although he studied with the quintessential early 20th-century American painter Robert Henri, Stuart Davis was profoundly influenced by European abstract art, especially the flattened planes of Cubist art that he saw at the 1913 Armory Show in New York. Later Davis also used the solid forms of signage and advertising to evoke the tempo of jazz and urban street life, as in this drawing.

Creating works that blur the boundaries between sculpture and furniture, he began his early studio pieces from the 1970s as found objects, usually mass-produced furniture. In the 1980s, he moved squarely into the realm of original design, producing rigorously reductive, geometric, and abstract pieces such as Low Piece (Bench). An example of Burton’s mature style, this piece conveys his passion for combining fine art and practical design and, in the process, opening up the scope of inquiry for both disciplines. All of Burton’s late works, including studio objects presented in traditional gallery spaces or site-specific projects for public areas, carry the potential for practical public use. Visitors are invited to use this sculpture as a bench.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/146904/low-piece-bench

He sought to find a new language for photographic depiction that could transcend what was in front of the camera. “First, and emphatically,” he wrote in 1950, “I accept the flat plane of the picture surface as the primary frame of reference of the picture.” Siskind’s radically abstract photographs of walls covered with graffiti, chalk, or peeling paint and paper would be recognized as a pioneering development in 20th-century photography.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/22556/peeling-paint-jerome-arizona

In 1930, at the beginning of her research, Abbott showed her photographs at the Museum of Modern Art, a success followed by one-person exhibitions at the Julien Levy Gallery in 1932 and the Museum of the City of New York in 1934. Abbott also received funding from the Works Progress Administration’s (WPA) Federal Arts Project, as noted in this photograph’s credit line. Her application to the WPA addressed New York’s fast tempo and emphasized “the vanishing instant,” yet Abbott’s studiously detailed compositions, prepared with a large-format camera and tripod, do not reflect this sense of rapidity.

This work extended to his collaborations with his wife, Sylvia (Laini) Abernathy, with whom he designed album covers for Delmark Records in the 1960s. Around that time, the poet and author Amiri Baraka (born LeRoi Jones) encountered Fundi’s photographs of Chicago and proposed a book project that would combine his poetry with Fundi’s images. The resulting collaboration, In Our Terribleness (Some Elements and Meaning in Black Style), designed by Laini and published in 1970, is both a statement about Black aesthetics and a call to action by the Black Power movement. As Baraka proclaimed, “Our terribleness is our survival as beautiful beings, anywhere.” The Screen and Mother’s Day both appeared in In Our Terribleness.

When they approach me they see only my surroundings, themselves, or figments of their imagination—indeed, everything and anything except me.—Ralph Ellison, Invisible Man, 1952By 1952 Gordon Parks had cemented his reputation as a successful photojournalist by becoming the first African American staff photographer at Life magazine. Ralph Ellison had just published his first and only finished novel, Invisible Man, regarded today as one of the most important American novels of the postwar period. That same year, these two artists and friends undertook the second of two magazine collaborations: a photo-essay for the August 25, 1952, issue of Life that introduced Ellison’s novel and titled “A Man Becomes Invisible.” These collaborations aimed to bring to national consciousness the black experience in postwar America, with Harlem as its nerve center.Written in the first person, Invisible Man recounts the journey of an unnamed black protagonist from the Deep South to Harlem. It is also a stark account of America’s racial divisions and of the narrator’s awakening to his condition of invisibility within the surrounding cultures of white and black alike—a realization that no one can see beyond what is projected onto the color of his skin.Within months of the novel’s publication, Parks and Ellison collaborated on “A Man Becomes Invisible”—although the level of Ellison’s involvement remains unclear. Parks set out to create photographs that illustrate Ellison’s text, depicting many of the novel’s key Harlem scenes: the protagonist’s brightly lit underground home, his rousing street speeches, the climactic accounts of the Harlem riots, and the iconic portrayal of the protagonist ending his hibernation and emerging aboveground. The resulting images are strikingly varied, including street photography, staged images shot in elaborately constructed sets, and surreal photomontages. They hew to Ellison’s prose style, which collapses distinctions between realism and fantasy. But the depictions are true not just to Ellison’s words but also to the emotions underlying them. Only four of these photographs were ever published in Life, but the dozens of surviving prints and contact sheets in Parks’s archive point to a larger, unrealized project.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/184381/untitled-new-york-harlem-from-the-series-a-man-becomes-invisible-1952

Initially, this inquiry led him to promote Pictorialism, a style imitative of painting. By the 1910s, however, he had renounced this painterly mode in favor of “straight photography,” exploring qualities that—so he argued—photography alone possessed. At his summer house on Lake George, in upstate New York, Stieglitz isolated the components of landscape, photographing clouds without any indication of a horizon line and sections of trees separated from the surrounding woods. In The Dancing Trees, the composition produced by the layered and interlaced trunks and branches highlights Stieglitz’s primary aim at this time: “to think more about the relationships in the pictures than subject–matter for its own sake.For more on the Alfred Stieglitz collection at the Art Institute, along with in-depth object information, please visit the website: The Alfred Stieglitz Collection.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/66526/the-dancing-trees

usa_2208,Louise Lawler,Silver dye-bleach print,Untitled,"Since the early 1980s, Louise Lawler has photographed works of art installed in auction houses, corporate headquarters, galleries, museums, and private homes in order to demonstrate how an object’s display and contextualization can shape its meaning. The resulting images transcend pure documentation. Her appropriation of works in situ addresses the broader social and economic issues that structure modes of presentation. These early photographs, often displayed as a triptych, deal with the theme of monogramming and, by extension, personal vanity. Depicting a couch with a Lacoste emblem, Alligator draws our attention to the Donald Judd sculpture above it and the reflection of the artist in its surface. Untitled shows a Jasper Johns painting, visible through the clear glass of a vitrine that exhibits Robert Rauschenberg’s oddly titled Monogram (1955–59; Moderna Museet, Stockholm). Lastly, Monogram depicts Johns’s White Flag (1955; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) hanging over a bed with a duvet lavishly embroidered with the owner’s initials. This sequence shows that Lawler is constantly making connections between various categories of signs, curatorial concerns of private collectors and museums, and the questions raised by redisplaying these pieces as the subject matter of “original” works of art.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/187167/untitled

In his reconfiguration of established themes, he eliminated narrative content and instead created abstract patterns that loosely convey a feeling or an idea. The thick acrylic paint produces a dynamic, textured surface; flat, overlapping fields of color create linear and chromatic rhythms and planes advance and recede in space. Despite deriving inspiration from canonical works of art, Thompson’s improvisatoinsal working method demonstrates affinities with the post-bebop jazz of the 1960s.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/146898/beach-of-silenus

He painted with overlapping transparent washes, employing little to no reworking, rewetting, or blotting. The artist used clear water, floating it into adjacent washes along the perimeter to achieve a hazy frame. Strikingly, he superimposed a structure of emphatic horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines painted with a wide brush and blue watercolor.

Her body of work is rigorous and investigative, with a resolute concentration on color manifested by exquisitely complex monochrome paintings. Hafif often employs paint mixtures she has made herself, grinding a pigment with a muller and combining it with linseed oil. Mass Tone: Manganese Blue, titled after the specific pigment used, is from the first series of paintings for which Hafif created her own paints in this way. Unlike commercial paint from the tube, which contains various additives and binders, her handmade paints can behave unpredictably. As Hafif has stated, this patient technique was chosen because it “let a color … express itself, reveal its multiple nuances.” Her process invites us to perceive each particular paint mixture as matter rather than simply as color.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/218575/mass-tone-manganese-blue

In 1961 and early 1962 Diebenkorn, who lived in Berkeley, California, taught briefly at the University of California, Los Angeles. He did not have a place to paint in Los Angeles, and at the invitation of Wesley Chamberlin, a graduate assistant in etching at the school, and later a printer-fellow at the Tamarind Institute, Diebenkorn began to make simple drypoints and etchings, drawn from life.At around the same time, Diebenkorn was invited to work on lithographs at Tamarind, where he produced three editions in June of 1961. He returned for an extended period in April and May, 1962, and produced several more lithographs that exemplify his keen awareness and appreciation of such European painter-printmaker masters as Edvard Munch, Henri Matisse, and Pablo Picasso.After his return to Berkeley in 1962, Diebenkorn met and began a fortuitous relationship with the great master printer and publisher Kathan Brown, who was just starting her Crown Point Press, enabling him to continue his printmaking activities. These early activities formed the foundation of his life-long pursuit of printmaking as a serious adjunct to his work in painting and drawing.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/117919/nude

Hugh Edwards featured Porter’s work in a 1963 exhibition that seems to have cemented his impressions of color photography, which was at this point largely reserved for commercial purposes. “At last I can feel certain,” the curator wrote to Porter, “that great photographs can be made in color—something I was skeptical about for so long.” The following year, the museum acquired 21 prints.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/20461/yellow-leaves-and-asters-sangre-de-cristo-mountains-new-mexico-september-20-1950

He did not rely on an initial pencil drawing, but instead worked quickly and loosely, tamping his brush repeatedly to capture the effect created by the hotel’s hundreds of shimmering windows. Leaving many areas of the paper white to show through his varied marks, Marin approximated the way the eye might move rapidly across such a scene.

His tool of choice was a Polaroid Big Shot, an instant film camera fitted with a fixed focal length that made it ideal for portraiture. Warhol often took multiple photographs of his subjects in order to capture their behavioral nuances. The tightly cropped format and a camera-mounted flash reduced features to flat planes and abstract shapes, making the images perfect for use in the silkscreen process. The sitter featured here, Bob Colacello, writer and former editor of Warhol’s Interview magazine, recalled that the artist tried to convince him to change his name to Bob Cola, as this “pop” reference would lend itself to fame.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/194304/bob-colacello

Greene’s twin pursuits of photography and archeology matched the larger 18th- and 19th-century penchant for memorializing lost civilizations through the wonders of modern technology. From the photographer Gustave Le Gray, Greene learned the newly perfected waxed-paper negative (a salted paper print technique), a process that was relatively easy to use in the field and which offered good tonal range as well as detail. In December 1855, he joined a French expedition to Algeria as the official photographer for the excavation of the Tomb of the Christian Woman, located outside Algiers. His pictures of the burial mound are enigmatic, focusing on the overall form of the structure rather than on particular archeological details.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/97328/tombeau-de-la-chretienne-vue-du-cote-nord-tomb-of-the-christian-woman-view-of-the-north-side

The suit’s trousers are shredded into strips, some of them suggestively bundled. Painted cardboard stands in for a shirt and tie.

usa_2340,Ed Ruscha,Color screenprint on ivory wove paper,Double Standard,"Ed Ruscha is a California-based artist whose work is associated with the Pop art movement. Standard Station marks the first time that Ruscha collaborated with a print publisher, who financed the edition but left the execution up to the artist. Ruscha’s book of photographs Twenty-six Gasoline Stations—specifically the page depicting a Standard Oil station in Amarillo, Texas—provided the model for this print as well as a painting he made in 1963. Perhaps the most notable feature of the print version of the image is the gradation of the colors in the sky. Ruscha achieved this effect through the “Split-Fountain” technique, which blends ink to create a rainbow effect. The technique originated in commercial printing and had been used in lithographic and screenprinting shops for many years, but Ruscha was one of the first to use it in fine-art printing. As art historian Riva Castleman has pointed out, the garish rainbow effect achieved by Ruscha in this print was so often imitated by other artists that, by the late 1960s, it had become a printing cliché.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/118134/double-standard

usa_2362,Sharon Lockhart,"16mm color film, optical sound; 32:30 min. loop Edition number three of six",NO,"Since the late 1990s, Los Angeles–based artist Sharon Lockhart has become widely known for her visually reductive, rigorously conceptual films. As a student, she was drawn to the work of Chantal Ackerman, Yvonne Rainer, Michael Snow, and Andy Warhol because of the way these artists negotiated the stasis of the photographic image with the narrative flow of cinema. Although candid in appearance, her films slowly reveal themselves to be the result of elaborate preparation and extensive collaboration with her subjects.Filmed in a continuous take with a fixed-angle camera, NO captures Masa and Yoko Ito, a Japanese farming couple, systematically mulching a plot of land. For over half an hour, they arrange tidy piles of straw and then disperse them over a field with minimalist, almost sculptural precision. Lockhart presents, documentary-style, a temporal sequence of events, but the film resists any clear narrative. Viewers share in a sense of discovery by watching the performance, yet they are actually being offered a sort of hyper-reality: the artist creates expectations that do not seem to correspond to the disproportionate attention she has paid to her mundane subject. Lockhart described her process in the following way: “I organized NO around the optics of seeing … I had the farmers make piles of hay in the reverse perspective of the camera, following the camera’s field of vision… . After working from background to foreground to make the piles, the farmers come in and slowly spread the hay over just that portion of the field revealed by the camera, from foreground to background, as if they are covering a canvas.” As the figures move through horizontal fields of color in a choreographed fashion, Lockhart’s film appears almost as a living landscape painting.This work is inspired by No-no ikebana, a freestyle form of Japanese flower arranging. The practice is based upon the cycles and rules of agriculture, using fruits and vegetables directly from the farm. As Lockhart has explained, “It highlights a relationship to nature and farming that is somewhat contrary to the overly mechanized large-scale agribusiness prevalent in the United States.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/184112/%E4%B9%8F

The piece has its origins in a libretto that was inspired by the artist’s conversations with his grandfather, an etching by Francisco de Goya featuring a donkey, and English translations of short stories by the Argentine writer Julio Cortázar. Mosley wrote his libretto in English, translated it into Spanish, back into English, and finally into Arabic. Like much of his work, including A Vue and dread, Beyrouth explores the behavioral rules of conversation and the structure of dialogue. In this case, the libretto developed into an operatic soundtrack created in collaboration with composer Toufic Farroukh and inserted within the enigmatic, dreamlike film.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/181097/beyrouth

Recognizing that the physical features of books affect our perception of their contents, Morell transformed these humble, familiar things in ways that continue to occupy him to this day.

Goldin’s pictures, however, present subjects living outside or against the conventional family life shown in typical snapshots. These photographs also bear witness to moments of utmost intimacy—lovemaking, violence, addiction, hospitalization—and to the rollercoaster of accompanying emotions.

By 1967 he had turned to photography to record time-based conceptual processes. In this work, the artist photographed rows of cubes from an angle and made negative prints. Bochner then cut them into quadrants and installed them in a random order. The term isomorph in the title refers to the equal areas of black and white in each image and in the composition as a whole. The final grouping of 16 Isomorphs (Negative) shows how Bochner could transform a single photograph of building blocks into a galaxy of nonexistent spaces.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/111641/sixteen-isomorphs-negative

Puryear first read Cane while he was teaching at Fisk University, in Nashville, his first experience living in the south. He said that he related to the point of view of a visitor “looking at what so defines blackness in America, the agricultural life of the South, the sharecropping that had grown out of slavery.” In the late 1990s Puryear was asked to contribute illustrations to a new edition of the book. About his work for the project, Puryear has commented:The overriding issue was to work in a two-dimensional medium. To make flat images is such a departure from what I do as a sculptor. I had seldom made woodcuts since my student days. The challenge was to create a set of images that would relate together in a familial way, suggestive of the narrative but not overtly so.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/158960/carma-from-cane

Look. During the 1960s, Kauffman turned to acrylic plastic as the primary supporting surface for his work. Compared to a traditional, stretched canvas support, in Le Mur s’en va I the plastic support is translucent, curving over on itself like a sheet of paper, and suspended away from the wall (as well as quite close to the floor). Indeed, the work’s French title indicates the wall “leaving” or “departing.” This candy-colored painting serves as its own kind of spatial partition, simultaneously three-dimensional and ethereal.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/111256/le-mur-s-en-va-the-wall-goes-away

Dove,"A trailblazing photographer who championed photography as a fine art, Alfred Stieglitz also played a key role in the development of modern art in the United States in the first half of the twentieth century. His renowned New York galleries showed photography, painting, prints, and sculpture, focusing on an important group of American painters that included Georgia O’Keeffe, John Marin, and Arthur Dove. Stieglitz made close-up, sober yet affectionate portraits of these artists. As Daniel Catton Rich, then director of the Art Institute of Chicago, put it in 1949, Stieglitz’s portraits of his fellow artists “came through a tremendous personal understanding; they are like records of deep friendships or a series of love affairs.”For more on the Alfred Stieglitz collection at the Art Institute, along with in-depth object information, please visit the website: The Alfred Stieglitz Collection.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/66342/arthur-g-dove

He engages not only history and contemporary culture but also the potential for alternative realities and future transformation.The giant, ominous, bodily forms of Untitled (lungs) manifest current political and social tensions through their own insistent physicality: they simultaneously project into the room and hang abjectly down toward the floor; their shapes are soft and organic, but their surfaces are opaque and appear calcified; they are absurdly larger than life, but they prompt greater awareness of our own fragile, pulsing bodies.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/236623/untitled-lungs

The title phrase ofhis important early work One Inch to a Foot makes obvious reference to scale notations on architectural plans. It is etched in one-inch high, Helvetica letters on the plate of a standard overhead projector; once projected, each letter measures one foot in height. Thus a representational convention of architectural plans is physically enacted, and the work carves out real space as well: the projector requires 15 feet of distance from the wall in order to execute the title statement. One Inch to a Foot is technically portable but always establishes a direct relationship to its site of installation.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/214932/one-inch-to-a-foot

usa_2518,Gertrude Käsebier,Gum bichromate print,The Red Man,"One of the leading Pictorialist photographers at the turn of the century, Gertrude Käsebier was known for softly focused, often allegorical images of women and children. In 1898 she began photographing the Sioux performers in Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show, a popular production featuring reenactments of the fading American Old West. By the turn of the century, Native Americans had been subjected to a series of intense armed conflicts, the restriction of tribal lands, and increased cultural assimilation, and many white Americans viewed them as an endangered people and harbored romantic visions of a disappearing “noble savage.” Käsebier, who had encountered Native Americans as a child in a Colorado frontier town, believed the subject of this photograph was “the last of a hundred”; she supposedly caught him off-guard in order to capture her vision of the archetypal Native American. Influential dealer and photographer Alfred Stieglitz published this image in 1903, in the opening issue of Camera Work.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/43842/the-red-man

It was during a 1933 assignment in Havana, Cuba, however, that he truly honed his eye as a social documentarian. Evans was hired by Carlton Beals to illustrate his book The Crime of Cuba, a polemical work that criticized American capitalists for their contribution to the island’s economic and political collapse. In the three weeks Evans spent in Havana, he was dismayed by the cultural crisis and police repression but visually delighted by the urban crowds, street grids, advertisements, and cinema posters. “It’s still a frontier town, and half savage, forgetful and unsafe,” he noted. “I have been drunk with this new city for days.” This photograph of a Cuban man—nonchalantly dapper in a white suit and skimmer hat, calling to mind the “dandy” figure praised by nineteenth-century critic and poet Charles Baudelaire—suggests Havana streets that were overwhelmingly male but racially diverse. Although omitted from Beals’s book, this image became one of Evans’s favorites, and he featured it in his landmark 1938 Museum of Modern Art exhibition and book, American Photographs.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/13733/citizen-in-downtown-havana-cuba

Early on Ledgerwood turned to traditionally “feminine” pastels and decorative forms in order to challenge the stereotypes of gendered approaches to painting: “I wanted to find a way to try to push the notion of what is feminine, and what is powerful in painting,” the artist has explained.Ledgerwood borrowed this work’s title, So What, from a 1959 “cool period” jazz composition by Miles Davis. Made during winter, the painting features pale colors evocative of the season and at first appears quiet and serene. Yet sustained looking reveals subtle modulations in the blue-green, yellow, and white circles, which recede and advance in complex alternation across the work’s surface.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/152755/so-what

He started by inserting fragments of poems into his paintings, as, for example, in We Two Boys Together Clinging (1961), which integrates two lines from a Walt Whitman poem of the same title. Fifteen years later, inspired by Wallace Stevens’s “The Man with the Blue Guitar” (1937), with its themes of representation and imaginative transformation, Hockney made 10 drawings in colored inks and crayons. With the aid of master printer Aldo Crommelynck those drawings were converted into 20 mixed intaglio prints using a color-etching process initially developed for Pablo Picasso.While not a literal illustration of Stevens’s poem, the print series The Blue Guitar interprets its themes in visual terms, and most of the images show Hockney’s love of Picasso. The print Old Guitarist juxtaposes the Art Institute’s famous painting of 1903–04 (1926.253) with later Picasso iconography. Other sheets likewise contrast Picasso’s different phases within the same image; throughout the series, Hockney distinguishes the disparate styles by using different colors.It is perhaps Hockney’s Blue Guitar that has perpetuated the idea that Wallace Stevens was similarly inspired by Picasso’s Old Guitarist. Although Stevens was familiar with modern art and no doubt saw the painting when it was exhibited at the Wadsworth Atheneum in 1934, he insisted that no one picture inspired his famous poem.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/131306/in-a-chiaroscuro-from-the-blue-guitar

In their work, he encountered two approaches that became fundamental to his own style: bold, insistent mark making and voids that are fully active.

There seemed to be something related to my deepest feeling in what I saw, and I decided to photograph what was within me.” For Stieglitz, who had returned from Europe to find that everyday use of the Kodak camera had supplanted serious photography, The Terminal represented new possibilities for photography and the hope for “an America in which I could breathe as a free man.”For more on the Alfred Stieglitz collection at the Art Institute, along with in-depth object information, please visit the website: The Alfred Stieglitz Collection.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/66312/the-terminal

The woman’s slender features and the lines of her dressing gown evoke a contemporary sitter yet, rather than a portrait, the work offers a broader interpretation of maternal affection.Raised and trained in Chicago, Vonnoh set up a studio in the city in the mid-1890s, garnering wide acclaim for her sculptures of female figures, whose small scale suited domestic spaces.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/71126/a-young-mother

Yet it has also consistently drawn into question the solidity and rigidity of the sculptural object. Here, as in most of his work, an empty glass cube sits on a Plexiglas plinth: this box mirrors its surroundings while at the same time allowing the viewer to look directly into and through it, to the gallery beyond. For the glass of Untitled (Terminal Series), Bell employed a vacuum-coating process, which adhered metallic layers to the panes of the cube in order to manipulate their potential to scatter and capture light. In 1968 the artist described his interest not simply in perceiving space but in creating it: “The space declared by these new sculptures becomes the work.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/33225/untitled-terminal-series

Although he considered himself a painter, Man Ray had been making and showing photographs since the later 1910s, and within a year of his relocation he devoted himself to photography as an experimental art form and a means of earning his living.Tristan Tzara, Man Ray’s close friend and a leader of the “anti-art” Dada movement, intro¬duced the artist in January 1922 to cameraless photographic images made by the German artist Christian Schad. Tzara had dubbed the works Schadographs, and Man Ray, already inclined toward subversive uses of objects and camera images, adopted both the procedure and the self-referential title: Rayographs were the result. A form of abstraction fashioned from industrial consumer goods (photo¬graphic paper and the sundry items placed on them), with the direct intervention of the human hand, Rayographs articulated a key Dada interest in homemade reworkings of the materials of industrial and consumer society.Man Ray turned, however, from Schad’s emphasis on grubby detritus and cheap photographic papers to more sumptuous gelatin silver sheets, and his Rayographs transformed objects and parts of the human body into fantastic signs of the real. In this he followed the lead of Pablo Picasso, particularly his Cubist collages of 1912–14, which juxtaposed real and depicted things and played with spatial relations to such an extent that art became not a window onto reality but a language of form.In summer 1922 Man Ray produced, in an edition of 40 copies, a portfolio of 12 photographs made from original Rayographs. The title, Delicious Fields (Champs délicieux) was a pun on the Elysian Fields, the resting place of the heroic and good in ancient Greek mythology. Tzara wrote the book’s preface, a declarative text titled “Photography Upside-Down,” which brilliantly sends up conventional art photography and art in general. Man Ray showed his Rayographs to Picasso, and he later recalled their impact: “I saw Picasso here on his knees before a photogram. He allowed that in many years he had not experienced as great a sensation of art as from it. Painting is dead, finished.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/131699/untitled

A protégé of the photographer Alfred Stieglitz, he designed the cover and layout of Stieglitz’s journal Camera Work, a publication championing the medium’s artistic potential. Steichen excelled at the gum bichromate process, which allowed artists to layer different colors and manipulate the emulsion, while still wet, in a painterly fashion; here, he was able to enhance highlights by removing pigment with a brush. As he wrote in the first issue of Camera Work, “every photograph is a fake from start to finish, a purely impersonal, unmanipulated photograph being practically impossible.”For more on Edward Steichen’s work in the Art Institute’s collection visit the website: Edward Steichen’s World War I Years.For more on the Alfred Stieglitz collection at the Art Institute, along with in-depth object information, please visit the website: The Alfred Stieglitz Collection.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/66695/midnight-lake-george

The project was completed in 1954, but Nickel continued photographing Sullivan’s work on his own, finding his calling in the identification, documentation, and preservation of these endangered works of art. Sullivan was revered as the father of the skyscraper and renowned for his use of architectural ornament. His firm, Adler and Sullivan, was based in Chicago, and the city was home to many examples of his work. But by the 1950s urban renewal projects prompted the demolition of his most celebrated structures, including the Garrick Theater and the Stock Exchange Building.For nearly two decades, Nickel campaigned to save Sullivan’s works, and when those efforts failed, he worked to rescue their ornament—the elaborate, nature-inspired decoration that adorned both the interiors and exteriors of Sullivan’s buildings. Nickel mourned the disappearance of a city he admired, warning that Chicago could move toward anonymity or, worse, become “a city of contrasts: The superficial glitter of the new mixed with the slum of the old.” Nickel’s photographs let the architecture take center stage, even if his documentation was later overshadowed by his efforts to rescue surviving structures and fragments. In 1972, one such attempt, in the Chicago Stock Exchange Building, cost him his life. The Sun-Times wrote: “Richard Nickel has become a true martyr to the cause of architectural preservation. He is irreplaceable, and Chicago architecture has lost its truest champion.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/49128/untitled-garrick-theater-proscenium-and-stage

His passion for boats was celebrated and, along with his forceful and emotional handling of paint, this subject became an icon of his persona. Here Marin used his wide three-centimeter brush, working the watercolor so vigorously that bristles became lodged on the work’s surface.

When Stieglitz saw the 21-year-old’s portfolio in 1900, he was sufficiently impressed to buy three prints. The two men gradually built a strong personal and professional relationship. Stieglitz promoted the younger artist through Camera Work, his exquisitely printed quarterly journal, and with Steichen’s help, he started the Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession, which eventually became known as Gallery 291. This rich platinum print depicting Stieglitz and his daughter Kitty reflects the prevailing aesthetic of fine-art photography around the turn of the 20th century. As proponents of pictorialism, Stieglitz, Steichen, and many of their contemporaries sought to elevate photography to the status of high art by infusing their work with handcraft and painterly effects.For more on the Alfred Stieglitz collection at the Art Institute, along with in-depth object information, please visit the website: The Alfred Stieglitz Collection.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/66834/kitty-and-alfred-stieglitz

Cobalt and Gold Study II, although small in scale, is an example of one of her signature modes of production during the 1970s. Benglis’s “study” of cobalt and gold is a conceptual one, using plaster and gold leaf as stand-ins to explore the fluidity of metal.

Moholy’s book Painting, Photography, Film, published in 1925 and again in 1927, argued that film and photography could give essentially new perspectives on art and contemporary life, if only their basic principles were fully understood and exploited. This photomontage is exceptional in its use of ink and in its relatively full composition—many of Moholy’s montages exploit blank space.

Oppenheim also opened sculpture (and exhibitions) to the effects of chance and other elements beyond the artist’s control.

usa_2785,David Hockney,Color etching and aquatint from two copper plates on white wove paper,"Serenade, from The Blue Guitar","Since the early 1960s, David Hockney has sought ways to meld his modern aesthetic style with highly personalized subject matter. He started by inserting fragments of poems into his paintings, as, for example, in We Two Boys Together Clinging (1961), which integrates two lines from a Walt Whitman poem of the same title. Fifteen years later, inspired by Wallace Stevens’s “The Man with the Blue Guitar” (1937), with its themes of representation and imaginative transformation, Hockney made 10 drawings in colored inks and crayons. With the aid of master printer Aldo Crommelynck those drawings were converted into 20 mixed intaglio prints using a color-etching process initially developed for Pablo Picasso.While not a literal illustration of Stevens’s poem, the print series The Blue Guitar interprets its themes in visual terms, and most of the images show Hockney’s love of Picasso. The print Old Guitarist juxtaposes the Art Institute’s famous painting of 1903–04 (1926.253) with later Picasso iconography. Other sheets likewise contrast Picasso’s different phases within the same image; throughout the series, Hockney distinguishes the disparate styles by using different colors.It is perhaps Hockney’s Blue Guitar that has perpetuated the idea that Wallace Stevens was similarly inspired by Picasso’s Old Guitarist.

usa_2788,Berenice Abbott,Gelatin silver print,"View of Exchange Place from Broadway, New York","Like many American artists of her generation, Berenice Abbott gravitated to Paris in the 1920s. There she met Eugène Atget, whose decades-long photographic archive of Paris influenced her to document the changing face of New York City as skyscrapers were replacing nineteenth-century buildings. In the midst of the Depression, she produced over 300 images; she distributed many to schools and libraries in New York, mounted several exhibitions, and published the project in 1939 under the title Changing New York. Here Abbott highlights the “new” New York, emphasizing the city’s modernity with extreme cropping of the skyscrapers. Yet by the time she made the picture in 1933, the buildings in the foreground were already relics: the canyon effect produced by their sheer verticality had inspired a zoning resolution in 1916, which stipulated that buildings above a certain height must have stepped facades as they rise to allow sunlight to reach the street.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/75647/view-of-exchange-place-from-broadway-new-york

First conceived in 1962, Box #53 belongs to a group of custom-made, yarn-covered boxes that incorporate stuffed birds. When the box is opened, a tape measure audibly calculates the height of the nine-inch opening. Inside are four compartments, one of which features a crystal encrusted rock. Box #53 embodies a number of implied contrasts: nature’s brilliantly hued birds and the man-made, colored yarn; the container’s relatively modest interior and its flamboyant exterior; and the muted rock and noisy measuring device. “I’m never interested in ambiguous response,” the artist said. “Rather a positive negative … touch or not touch, the quality of seducing-repelling.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/37371/box-53

Hollander, one of the first printers to receive training at Tamarind, established his own workshop in New York in 1964, the first such establishment in the eastern United States to grow out of the Tamarind operation.Of the fourteen new editions of prints Nevelson produced, only two were lithographs. Innerview, with its collaged element, shows her growing sophistication with printed components. Close inspection reveals that the collaged part is a section of the underlying drawing, printed on a different color of paper, cut out and laid down. Both the method and materiality of this print recall the assemblage technique of Nevelson’s sculpture.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/31998/inner-view

The images Gardner produced over the next four years—documenting the aftermath of battles and the life of soldiers in camp—were seen primarily in exhibitions and circulated in smaller form as cartes de visite. He published Gardner’s Photographic Sketch Book of the War in 1865, at the war’s end. With two volumes of 50 albumen prints each, the album retailed for $150—the equivalent of several months of an average worker’s wages—making it a luxury item. According to the photographer, “What do I want, John Henry?” was a question this Union captain frequently asked his servant (ex-slaves most often served the Northern army as cooks and laborers). On the page accompanying this photograph, Gardner patronizingly described John Henry as an “affectionate creature” of “untutored nature,” who was grateful for his newfound freedom at the war’s end.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/196400/what-do-i-want-john-henry

For this table, Kagan’s muse was Constantin Brancusi’s sculpture Bird in Space, whose subtle, tapering curves inspired the spectacular base, a design that Kagan described as one of his favorites. While the pointed thrust of the table evokes the aerodynamics of the nascent space age, the tabletop owes a debt to the undulating, biomorphic shapes of Surrealism. Despite these cutting-edge associations, the table also represents a departure from the machine aesthetic of earlier decades and a return to handcrafting: with his business partner, Hugo Dreyfuss, Kagan designed all his furnishings, which were custom-made under the supervision of his father, Illi, a trained cabinetmaker.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/200165/free-form-occasional-table

Piss Christ belonged to a series showing various statuettes immersed in bodily fluids: blood, milk, urine, and semen. Each composition was printed at a grand scale that elevated the miniatures to the level of worship. This work, involving milk and water, was created in response to the Piss Christ controversy.

usa_2882,Martin Wong,Acrylic on canvas,Sweet Oblivion,"Martin Wong’s singular approach to painting combines painstaking documentary realism with highly charged symbols and decorative motifs to reflect a culturally diverse worldview. Wong studied ceramics in northern California and was a member of several performance troupes in San Francisco before eventually becoming a self-taught painter and moving to New York. He arrived in 1978 and joined the lively East Village art scene, filled with artists making political work about their personal and cultural experiences. His urban landscapes show a critical engagement with gritty everyday scenes; an obsessive focus on detail; a flair for ornamentation; and an affinity for language, symbols, and storytelling.Illustrating a modern-day ruin with the epic scale of traditional history painting, Sweet Oblivion depicts a decaying tenement near the artist’s home and studio in the Lower East Side neighborhood of Manhattan. The fortresslike buildings—made up of hundreds of minute, individually rendered bricks—are surrounded by a sea of refuse and rubble. Alighting on the surface of a fiery, apocalyptic sky, two groupings of Wong’s trademark hands reiterate the caption in American Sign Language finger spelling: “Sweet Oblivion, Clinton on the other side of Delancy Street.” Typical of Wong’s canvases, in which the harsh realities of urban life are offset with an uncommon optimism, the delicately gilded, stylized characters—which pay homage to graffiti art, Persian scripts, and hieroglyphics—appear here as emblems of beauty and hope in an otherwise bleak scene.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/214282/sweet-oblivion

The left image, depicting two white women in a lush, idyllic setting, is paired with a militaristic scene in which white men in uniforms execute two black men before a crowd of onlookers. Simpson typically conjoins text and image in her work; however, the absence of text in this piece-perhaps signifying an unfinished work-forces the viewer to establish formal and narrative relationships. The juxtaposition of these images speaks to the manner in which gender, race, sexuality, and authority have been historically constructed, represented, and exercised.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/146894/untitled

With this project, he sought to capture the changing American landscape at the end of the 20th century by presenting a sampling of what the country’s residents looked like at that moment. These seemingly casual, chance encounters were in fact photographed with a camera that uses 8 x 10–inch film, a so-called large-format apparatus that requires considerable time to set up for an exposure. Throughout this coast-to-coast survey, Sternfeld concentrated on the dress, pose, and material possessions of his unnamed subjects—details that invite various assumptions yet, separated from the broader world, resist a definitive typecasting.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/121245/a-woman-out-shopping-with-her-pet-rabbit-santa-monica-california-from-the-series-stranger-passing

Puryear first read Cane while he was teaching at Fisk University, in Nashville, his first experience living in the south. He said that he related to the point of view of a visitor “looking at what so defines blackness in America, the agricultural life of the South, the sharecropping that had grown out of slavery.” In the late 1990s Puryear was asked to contribute illustrations to a new edition of the book. About his work for the project, Puryear has commented:The overriding issue was to work in a two-dimensional medium. To make flat images is such a departure from what I do as a sculptor.

In this episode a profoundly lonely spaceman builds a robot and instructs it to give him a Christmas present; the final sequence reveals the scheme’s comic ending.

Her paintings always include, to some degree, deliberate experimental alterations such as messy drips, rogue brushstrokes, and unexpected color combinations. Here these attributes predominate. Evincing an unusual freedom of lyrical and light gestures, Heaven is an exceptional work in Heilmann’s oeuvre.

Completed in the last year of his life, this project—an essay and 20 detailed plates— outlines Sullivan’s belief that ornament was the supreme expression of a designer’s intellect and creative freedom. The resulting 1924 publication, A System of Architectural Ornament According with a Philosophy of Man’s Powers, was highly influential for the next generation of architects in Chicago and remains a powerful expression of Sullivan’s ideals about organic and modern American architecture.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/190992/system-of-architectural-ornament-plate-20-finis

The Wind is among the first of these tarpaulin paintings.Schnabel’s figurative and abstract images, drawn from a wide variety of literary and art historical sources, as well as the artist’s own experience and imagination, interact and combine into thematically unified works. Selected for their color and texture, unconventional materials (animal hide, blankets, velvet, and tarpaulin) are used as grounds upon which Schnabel builds up wax, modeleing paste, and pigment, producing beatuifully worked, but agitated surfaces. found objects, particularly the broken ceramics that have been identified with Schnabel’s work, are often employed as formal elements and create numerous interplays between the thick, three-dimensional surfaces and the orginal two-dimensionality of the grounds.

Eggleston catapulted to notoriety when the Museum of Modern Art organized a one-person show in 1976, accompanied by a monograph, William Eggleston’s Guide. Many initial reactions to the show were negative—color photography was thought to be the purview of commercial work, and the elevation of the mundane as subject matter was met with skepticism—but the show affirmed that serious art could be made in color and with unassuming or even lowbrow subjects. This nearly monochromatic photograph of an oven in Eggleston’s hometown of Memphis, included in the Guide, hints simultaneously at domestic comfort and potential danger.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/188843/memphis

In addition, the cork feet of the glasses provide built-in coasters, while the shaker’s cork-covered neck doubles as an insulated handle.

This drawing, given to the museum by the artist in the 1960s, is one of many studies for the Art Institute’s painting The Rock (1956.338). Taken as a group, these studies demonstrate the artist’s working method and show the progression of The Rock from an idea to the finished painting.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/113688/study-for-the-rock

usa_2988,Aaron Siskind,Gelatin silver print,Chicago 42,"Although he began his career as a documentarian, Aaron Siskind quickly became known for photographs that concerned themselves with exploring internal formal relationships rather than depicting recognizable objects. Active in the artistic milieu of postwar New York, Siskind made photographs in dialogue with the work of the Abstract Expressionist painters, with whom he was socially and professionally close. He sought to find a new language for photographic depiction that could transcend what was in front of the camera. “First, and emphatically,” he wrote in 1950, “I accept the flat plane of the picture surface as the primary frame of reference of the picture.” Siskind’s radically abstract photographs of walls covered with graffiti, chalk, or peeling paint and paper would be recognized as a pioneering development in 20th-century photography.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/2964/chicago-42
usa_2989,Harry Callahan,Gelatin silver print,"Eleanor and Barbara, Chicago","Harry Callahan was one of the most influential photographers of the 20th century, famed for his experimentation and his humanistic approach. He taught at Chicago’s Institute of Design from 1946 to 1961, and during this period he embarked on an innovative series featuring his wife, Eleanor, and their daughter, Barbara. Callahan combined features of casual snapshots (frontally posed figures, central framing, and harsh shadows) with the inherent qualities of an 8 × 10 camera (intense clarity, stillness, and large scale). This photograph from the series entered the collection at the end of Hugh Edwards’s tenure. Before retirement, Edwards wrote these departing words to Callahan: “As for so many others, your work, teaching, and influence have always been an inspiration for me and so they will continue to be.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/33867/eleanor-and-barbara-chicago

usa_2992,Jasper Johns,Color lithograph on white wove paper,Savarin,"This variation on the Savarin theme evokes Edvard Munch’s masterful self-portrait in lithography (see 1963.281). The letters “E. M.”, at lower right, directly refer to him. As in the Munch print, Johns has included a ghostly arm in the bottom panel of the composition. The key difference, however, is that Johns has used the Savarin can in place of his own likeness.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/97415/savarin

usa_2997,Julia Fish,Oil on canvas,"Living Rooms: SouthEast-One, with lights, action","Julia Fish’s methodical, meditative paintings are abstracted and excerpted from her own personal experiences, memories, and immediate surroundings. Since 1991 she has drawn most often from the architectural elements of her home. “The house has become a constant companion—in a sense I live inside the subject of my work,” she has said. Shifting her perspective and relation to her surrounding environment, Fish’s Living Room paintings began as tracings from her residence’s second-floor plan: the sources of light and repeated movements are indicated by a set of marks and signs, specific to the images of each of 10 rooms. With tremendous authority and skill, Fish turns mindful recordings of studied details from her everyday experiences into a practical and strategic reflection on minimal representation and the ordinary structures that surround our daily lives.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/185069/living-rooms-southeast-one-with-lights-action

usa_3000,Aaron Siskind,Gelatin silver print,Walker Warehouse,"As a member of New York’s Photo League in the 1930s, Aaron Siskind led classes that produced social documentary projects. During those years, he also created photographic studies of vernacular architecture on Martha’s Vineyard and in Bucks County, Pennsylvania. When he began teaching at the Institute of Design in 1951, he was thus perfectly suited to lead the Sullivan Project with a group of students, among them Richard Nickel (see related photographs on view nearby). The project aimed to comprehensively document buildings designed by the early 20th-century architect Louis Sullivan that were slated for demolition to make way for urban renewal projects. This photograph shows the Walker Warehouse, completed in 1889, just as it was being torn down. Like many of Siskind’s images, this one focuses on Sullivan’s elegant use of ornament even in utilitarian structures.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/50916/walker-warehouse
