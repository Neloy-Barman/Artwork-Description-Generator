eng_1,Francis Bacon,Oil on canvas,Figure with Meat,"Permeated by anguished visions of humanity, Francis Bacon’s paintings embody the existential ethos of the postwar era. In his powerful, nihilistic works, tormented and deformed figures become players in dark, unresolved dramas. Bacon often referred in his paintings to the history of art, interpreting borrowed images through his own bleak mentality. Figure with Meat is part of a now-famous series he devoted to Diego Velázquez’s Portrait of Pope Innocent X (c. 1650; Galleria Doria-Pamphilj, Rome). Here he transformed the Spanish Baroque artist’s iconic portrayal of papal authority into a nightmarish image, in which the blurred figure of the pope, seen as if through a veil, seems trapped in a glass-box torture chamber, his mouth open in a silent scream. Instead of the noble drapery that frames Velázquez’s pope, Bacon is flanked by two sides of beef, quoting the work of seventeenth-century Dutch artist Rembrandt van Rijn and twentieth-century Russian artist Chaim Soutine, both of whom painted brutal and haunting images of raw meat. Framed by the carcass, Bacon’s pope can be seen alternately as a depraved butcher, or as much a victim as the slaughtered animal hanging behind him.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/4884/figure-with-meat
eng_2,David Hockney,Acrylic on canvas,American Collectors (Fred and Marcia Weisman),"One of England’s most versatile and inventive artists of the postwar era, the painter, printmaker, set designer, and photographer David Hockney settled in Los Angeles in 1964. His work since then has often reflected, with wit and incision, the sun-washed flatness of the Southern California environment. Perhaps the most iconic example from a group of double portraits of friends and associates from the 1960s, this large painting depicts contemporary-art collectors Fred and Marcia Weisman in the sculpture garden of their Los Angeles home. As Hockney said, “The portrait wasn’t just in the faces, it was in the whole setting.” As relentlessly stiff and still as the objects surrounding them, the couple stands apart, his stance echoed in the totem pole to the right, hers in the figurative sculpture behind her. Mrs. Weisman’s distorted mouth also mirrors that of the totem pole. Mr. Weisman’s shadow falls possessively over the abstract sculpture at his feet. His hand is clenched so tightly it seems as if he were squeezing paint out of his fist (Hockney deliberately left the drips). Brilliant, raking light flattens and abstracts the scene. This pervasive aridity is reinforced by the segregation of living, green foliage, including the lonely potted tree, to the edges of the painting. Unsurprisingly, the Weismans did not favor Hockney’s harsh portrayal and did not keep the painting.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/102234/american-collectors-fred-and-marcia-weisman
eng_3,Joseph Mallord William Turner,Oil on canvas,Fishing Boats with Hucksters Bargaining for Fish,"In this massive painting, celebrated British landscape artist Joseph Mallord William Turner pursued a theme of longstanding interest to him: the sea. On the left, a large fishing vessel engages in business with a huckster, or peddler, who stands in a small boat in the shadows to the right, gesturing with a raised arm. Both the subject and low horizon draw on the tradition of 17th-century Dutch marine painting, but the work also reflects Turner’s growing interest in dramatic effects of atmosphere and light. In the distance, the artist included a steam-driven vessel trailing a plume of dark smoke, which alludes to the arrival of a new, modern era at sea.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/4796/fishing-boats-with-hucksters-bargaining-for-fish
eng_4,Dante Gabriel Rossetti,Oil on canvas,Beata Beatrix,"Both a poet and a painter, Dante Gabriel Rossetti was a founder of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, a circle of Victorian artists who were united in their regard for medieval aesthetics. Named after the thirteenth-century poet Dante Alighieri, Rossetti found inspiration for Beata Beatrix in his namesake’s La vita nuova (The New Life; 1295). Rossetti’s scene draws a parallel between Dante’s love for the late Beatrice and his own affection for his recently deceased wife and muse, Elizabeth Siddal. While this picture is a tribute to Siddal, Rossetti was adamant that it does not represent her death. Rather, the work portrays her as if in a trance or altered spiritual state.Rossetti’s symbolism combines details from his personal life with those from La Vita Nuova. “The Dove” was the artist’s nickname for Siddal, and a haloed dove delivers her a white poppy, a symbol of laudanum—a derivative of opium—which caused her death by overdose. Above rises the Ponte Vecchio, the Florentine bridge that served as the setting of Dante’s poem. To the upper left is the personification of Love and to the right the figure of Dante, who doubles as a representation of Rossetti himself. The sundial shadows the number nine, the age Dante first saw Beatrice as well as the hour and day of her death. Rossetti designed the frame, and at the top right he inscribed, “How doth the city sit solitary.” This quote from La Vita Nuova refers to the city of Florence’s mourning of Beatrice.Given the deeply personal nature of the work, Rossetti initially refused his patron William Graham’s request to create a replica, although he eventually yielded. The Art Institute’s painting is this second version, which is the only one to have a predella—the painted scene at the bottom of the frame—depicting Beatrice and Dante’s reunion in paradise. With this addition, Rossetti provides the medieval love story with a happy conclusion, perhaps suggesting that he, too, had begun to come to terms with his own profound grief.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/16551/beata-beatrix
eng_5,Steve McQueen,"Caribs' Leap: 8mm and 35mm color film, sound, transferred to two-channel digital color video (projection), 28:53 min. loop, and 12:06 min. loop, edition number two of four; Western Deep: 8mm color film, sound, transferred to digital video (projection), 24:12 min. loop; edition number two of four",Caribs’ Leap/Western Deep,"British artist Steve McQueen’s projected video and film installations are rich in cinematic tradition and compelling in content. His earliest works—black-and-white silent films—are indebted to 1960s structural filmmaking, wherein the mechanics of shooting and projection become essential components of the film’s subject. His more recent work explores the relation between the medium and the spectator. At once confrontational and seductive, these colossally scaled works transform a purely visual experience into a visceral event. Presented as a single installation, Caribs’ Leap and Western Deep are linked by the theme of descent. The dual-screen projection Caribs’ Leap juxtaposes luminous scenes of the beachfront on the island of Grenada—the birthplace of McQueen’s parents—with irregular images of tiny figures falling through a vast sky. The latter pay homage to the island’s indigenous Caribs, who in 1651 leapt to their death rather than surrender to the invading French. In Western Deep, the viewer takes a nightmarish journey into the hot, noisy depths of a South African goldmine. Presented and considered together, these two films suggestively liken modern mining conditions to a historical act of genocide.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/181091/caribs-leap-western-deep
eng_6,John Constable,Oil on canvas,Stoke-by-Nayland,"John Constable produced this full-size oil sketch near the end of his life, for an unrealized painting. It depicts the artist’s favored subject matter: the countryside of his youth in Suffolk, England. He wrote to a friend of this work: “What say you to a summer morning? July or August, at eight or nine o’clock, after a slight shower during the night.” To achieve the effect of sparkling wetness and the freshness of earth and air, Constable painted as much with a palette knife as with a brush, flecking the surface with white highlights as he sketched and scraped the picture into existence.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/4758/stoke-by-nayland
eng_7,Sir Joshua Reynolds,Oil on canvas,Lady Sarah Bunbury Sacrificing to the Graces,"Dressed in Classically inspired robes, Lady Sarah Bunbury pours a libation of oil as an offering to the Three Graces, positioned behind her. Her soon-to-be husband, Charles Bunbury, commissioned this marriage portrait, making her association with the Graces—symbols of fertility and attendants to the Roman goddess of love, Venus—all the more appropriate.The first president of the Royal Academy in London, Sir Joshua Reynolds urged his fellow artists to paint historical and edifying subjects based on the art of antiquity and the Renaissance. As a portrait painter, he developed a grand style that ennobled the genre by giving his sitters Classical attributes and poses.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/4788/lady-sarah-bunbury-sacrificing-to-the-graces
eng_8,John Singleton Copley,Oil on canvas,Mrs. Daniel Hubbard (Mary Greene),"John Singleton Copley was largely self-taught, his only formal training from his stepfather Peter Pelham, an English artist who specialized in mezzotint engraving. He nonetheless garnered considerable success as a portrait painter before the Revolutionary War. The sitter here, Mary Greene Hubbard, was a member of Boston’s merchant class (Copley’s portrait of her husband, Daniel Hubbard [1947.27], is also in the Art Institute collection). Her pose, gown, and background were precisely copied from a British engraving of a noblewoman, yet Copley distinguished the work as his own by capturing the figure’s individual features as well as the surfaces and colors of the luxurious fabrics. A decade later, he left colonial Massachusetts for England to further his career and simultaneously escape the strong political divides among family, friends, and patrons amid the impending Revolution.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/59787/mrs-daniel-hubbard-mary-greene
eng_9,Leonora Carrington,Graphite and casein on panel,Juan Soriano De Lacandón,"In 1964 the artist Leonora Carrington painted this imaginative portrait of her friend, the self-taught artist Juan Soriano. A member of Surrealist circles in Paris and New York City during the 1930s and 1940s, Carrington settled in Mexico in 1942 after the trauma of fleeing war-torn Europe. Mexico occupied an important place in the imagination of many European artists—André Breton called it the “Surrealist place par excellence”—and for Carrington the country came to be a source of inspiration and wonder.Juan Soriano De Lacandón was one of the first paintings in which Carrington combined her Surrealist-inspired dreamscapes with Mexico’s history, culture, and ancient practices. Inspired by her study of the indigenous Lacandón people for a 1963 mural commission, The Magical World of the Maya (Museo de Antropología e Historia, Mexico City), the artist portrayed Soriano surrounded by the flora and fauna of ancient Mayan mythology. Bearing the scarification marks of a shaman, he holds in his hand a small jaguar, admired by the Maya as a spiritually powerful creature and a conduit to the underworld. According to native belief, the shaman alone was privileged to assume the form of the jaguar. This notion of animal incarnation may have resonated with Carrington, who adopted the horse as a type of alter ego in her earlier work. In presenting Soriano as a revered holy man, the artist demonstrated her deep admiration for her subject. Her use of precolonial symbolism also suggests her assimilation into the world of her adopted homeland, where she remained until her death.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/118661/juan-soriano-de-lacandon
eng_10,Edward William Godwin (Designer),Ebonized mahogany with glass and silvered brass,Sideboard,"Celebrated as the “poet of architects and architect of all the arts,” Edward William Godwin was a man of many accomplishments. In a career that spanned more than thirty-five years, he was an architect of civic, domestic, and ecclesiastical buildings; an innovative interior decorator and designer of furniture, textiles, and theater sets; and an articulate critic of art and architecture. Godwin first designed his ebonized sideboard, of which this is a variant model, for his own dining room in 1867, and he subsequently reconsidered the form over the next two decades. In its appearance, the sideboard represents a turning away from the weight of contemporary Gothic Revival aesthetics and a move toward a reductionist sensibility expressed through the balance of solids and voids. This spare style gained Godwin some notable contemporary clients, among them James McNeill Whistler and Oscar Wilde. In his 1904 study The English House, the influential German critic Hermann Muthesius wrote that Godwin’s furniture, including this sideboard, foreshadowed the more modern look that emerged at the turn of the twentieth century. While calling Godwin’s creations “wildly picturesque,” Muthesius concluded that the overall effect was “one of elegance.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/186047/sideboard
eng_11,Sir Thomas Lawrence,Oil on canvas,Isabella Wolff,"Produced over the course of 12 years, this portrait depicts Isabella Wolff, one of Sir Thomas Lawrence’s most intimate friends, contemplating a printed image of the Delphic Sibyl from Michelangelo’s famous Sistine Chapel ceiling. Wolff’s serpentine pose cleverly echoes another Sibyl from that same work. The Sibyls were priestesses of Classical legend who made enigmatic judgments and prophecies. They were often pictured according to Western fantasies of the Near East, hence Wolff’s elaborate turban here. Lawrence was famed for his ability to evoke the surface effects and textures of clothing; that talent is on full display in Wolff’s shimmering satin gown.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/4773/isabella-wolff
eng_12,Joseph Wright of Derby,Monochrome pastel (grisaille) on blue-gray laid paper,Self-Portrait in a Fur Cap,"Joseph Wright, a leading artist of the eighteenth century, spent most of his life in the central Midlands town of Derby, where he ran a successful portrait-painting practice. His best work in this vein portrays solid middle-class citizens, much like himself, with a keen perceptiveness of both character and physical appearance. Throughout his career, Wright was preoccupied with the evocative effects of light, specifically those produced by a single light source such as a candle, and the resulting play of shadows. Influenced by the powerful chiaroscuro of the superb mezzotints of Thomas Frye, a contemporary printmaker, Wright produced a number of dramatically lit self-portraits in oil, charcoal, and black-and-white pastel during the mid-1760s. Depicting himself in nocturnal lighting, wearing an exotic black hat, the artist evoked a time-honored tradition in portraiture: the deeply pensive artist who confronts himself and the viewer with a quiet challenge. Wright later ventured into landscape and genre subjects, the most original of which are concerned with the exploration of light phenomena. Portrait commissions continued to be a reliable source of income throughout his career.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/76295/self-portrait-in-a-fur-cap
eng_13,,"Silk cut and voided velvet, linen appliqué, silk and gilt metallic thread embroidery, and metal spangles",Cope,"The production of textiles for churches—hangings, altar frontals, and liturgical vestments—was a thriving industry in Europe from the twelfth century through the eighteenth century. Among the finest ecclesiastical vestments is this resplendent velvet cope, a semicircular cloak worn as an outer garment in processions or during special ceremonies by a priest or bishop. The elegant needlework was called opus anglicanum (English work). Surrounding the cope’s central image of the Assumption of the Virgin, rendered in silk and gold threads, are seraphim standing on wheels, thistles, fleurs-de-lis, and double-headed eagles—all connected by tendrils animated by spangles. Old Testament prophets and New Testament saints with their attributes alternate on the orphrey band, which runs the full width of the work. Saint Paul is depicted on the hood, which rests on the back of the cope, while an image of God holding an orb decorates the morse, or closure. The brown-velvet ground is an unusual color for vestments of this style; it may have faded from purple or crimson.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/36132/cope
eng_14,William Henry Fox Talbot,Photogenic drawing,Two Plant Specimens,"Contained within this haunting and poetic image is the seed of photography: the possibility of creating a negative from which an unlimited number of positives can be made. William Henry Fox Talbot produced this image by placing botanical specimens on sensitized paper and exposing them to light. He made this groundbreaking discovery after his 1833 honeymoon on the shores of Lake Como, in Lombardy, Italy. Frustrated by his inability to draw his Italian surroundings accurately, Talbot recalled the fleeting images of external objects that appeared within a camera lucida (an optical prism that creates a superimposed image on an artist’s drawing surface) and wondered how he could make them “imprint themselves durably, and remain fixed upon the paper.” What resulted, two years later, were the first camera negatives. Unveiled in 1839 and called photogenic drawing, Talbot’s process was perfected two years later into the calotype (from the Greek word kalos, meaning “beautiful”). By the end of his life, Talbot—whose far-ranging interests included mathematics, botany, etymology, and ancient Assyria—had also discovered the basis of halftone printing, obtained twelve patents, and authored seven books, including one of the first photographically illustrated books, The Pencil of Nature (1844).",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/38930/two-plant-specimens
eng_15,Mackay Hugh Baillie Scott (Designer),"Oak, ebony, ivory, mother-of-pearl, and copper",Manxman Piano,"A product of the Arts and Crafts movement in England, the Manxman Piano represents an innovative solution to the somewhat awkward form of the upright piano. Motivated by the shoddy results of industrial mass production, the movement advocated the recognition of furniture and decorative arts as works of art. Here the celebrated English architect and designer Mackay Hugh Baillie Scott created an object that is both cleverly functional and aesthetically pleasing. When opened, the lid and doors of the strikingly decorated cabinet act as acoustical sounding boards. Revealed inside is the musical instrument itself, along with a profusion of exquisite handcrafted metalwork, including candleholders fixed to the sides of the case. The overall design, like the keyboard, is a study in contrasts of light and dark; the lower section’s alternating pattern echoes the piano’s keys. A Manxman is an inhabitant of the Isle of Man, and the term derives from Scott’s early residence there. This piano is one of a number executed around 1900 with John Broadwood and Sons of London, who made the musical movements.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/103943/manxman-piano
eng_16,Julia Margaret Cameron,Albumen print,Mrs. Herbert Duckworth,"Julia Margaret Cameron began photographing at age forty-eight, after receiving a camera as a gift from her daughter and son-in-law. She soon became obsessed with photography, reveling in its messy magic and focusing more on the overall effects of her pictures than on technical perfection. Although she made portraits of some of the most important men of her day, Cameron’s female subjects helped her to explore the realm of mythology and imagination in highly allegorical and literary pictures. She delighted in dressing and posing friends, relatives, and servants as the Virgin Mary, Queen Esther, or Shakespeare’s faithful Cordelia. Julia Jackson, Cameron’s niece, was one of the few female sitters who posed for the photographer as herself. Known as a great beauty throughout her life, she was a favorite subject for Cameron, who took dozens of photographs of her over the course of ten years. In April 1867, shortly before Jackson’s wedding to her first husband, Herbert Duckworth, Cameron made a series of head-on portraits of the young bride-to-be that alternately reveal Jackson as noble, tender, and vulnerable. In this photograph, made after the wedding, Cameron captured Jackson’s mature beauty and extraordinary strength.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/157056/mrs-herbert-duckworth

A typical commercial portrait of the time presented a small standing figure, sharply focused and evenly lit. By contrast, Cameron’s photograph of her niece Julia Jackson concentrates on the subject’s head, showing clearly only limited planes of her face and leaving half of it shrouded in shadow. Known as a great beauty, Jackson was a favorite subject for Cameron, who made dozens of photographs of her.

Thistles captures the tangled movement of the windblown plants in light and shadow.

eng_60,Glenn Brown,Oil on panel,Dark Star,"Adopting imagery from a diverse array of artists—including Salvador Dalí, Frank Auerbach, and science fiction illustrator Chris Foss—Glenn Brown’s paintings transform his original sources into works of swirling, brightly colored paint. Copied from reproductions, his distortions project his manipulated figures into an eerily futuristic world. A direct quotation of Rembrandt van Rijn’s A Bust of a Young Woman Smiling (1633; Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister, Dresden), Dark Star both captures and parodies the subtle expression of the original, yet still mimics its lush surface. Brown’s brushwork is actually thin, even glassy, rendering Rembrandt’s strokes utterly nontactile, their texture an illusion. The title, Dark Star, perhaps quoting the low-budget 1970s astronaut film of the same name, evokes the appeal of the science-fiction genre, serving to transport an Old Master painting into, or perhaps beyond, the realm of kitsch.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/182391/dark-star

His joiners aim to get “closer to the way that we actually look at things, closer to the truth of experience.” They eschew the single-point perspective of a traditional photograph in favor of an image containing an accumulation of individual perspectives. Depicting the artist in bed—in the act of taking his own image in the facing mirror, surrounded by newspapers and brochures, cigarettes, and the furnishings of his hotel room—this self-portrait shows his morning as a duration instead of a single moment in time.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/100864/sunday-morning-mayflower-hotel-n-y

eng_67,Steve McQueen,"Super 8 film, silent, transferred to digital video (monitor); 1:05 min. loop Edition number two of four",Exodus,"Steve McQueen is an artist and filmmaker of Grenadian descent who was born and raised in London and lives in Amsterdam. In his reductive, often abstracted works, he pares down the projected image to its basic elements: light and dark, motion and stillness, silence and sound. The meanings in McQueen’s intensely concentrated films and projected-image installations—some exquisitely choreographed, others improvised—are at once elusive, elliptical, and subtly transgressive. Avant-garde film traditions, including cinema verité and the revolutionary films of figures such as Buster Keaton, Jean Vigo, and Andy Warhol inform McQueen’s improvisational approach, which is often defined by his preference for the handheld camera; distilled but coded actions, gestures, and performative expressions; and restrained post-production editing. Often, the bodies featured in the work include the artist’s own; almost always, they are black. With little interest in excavating the repressed psychological history of the African diaspora or exploring identity politics per se, McQueen instead facilitates his subjects’ creative empowerment through succinct works that leave ultimate interpretation to the viewer.Exodus, McQueen’s first mature effort, distinguishes itself from the balance of his oeuvre in that it captures an event that the artist happened to encounter while out with his handheld Super 8 camera. This short, silent film documents two smartly dressed men from the West Indies moving through the crowded streets of London. Each carries a potted coconut palm, a crude, if accidental, symbol of the tropics. Despite the burdens they carry and the challenges of navigating the city, they move efficiently through their environment, integrated with it even as the merrily waving palms above their heads distinguish them in the crowd. Their pace soon outstrips McQueen’s, and they move away from the recording device that documents—even questions—their actions. They cross against oncoming traffic and deftly board a double-decker bus. The final scene shows one of the men waving from a rear window as the vehicle moves away. Like the 1977 song of the same name by renowned reggae singer Bob Marley, Exodus is a poetic, largely metaphoric consideration of experiences and migrations within the global black diaspora.— Entry, Film, Video, New Media, Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies 35 (1), pp. 92–97.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/184204/%E7%A1%85%E6%91%AF%E7%8D%B5

eng_88,Tacita Dean,"16mm anamorphic color film, optical sound; 4 min. loop; edition 2 of 3",Disappearance at Sea II,"Since the mid-1990s, Tacita Dean has produced numerous drawings and photographs, extensive writings about her work, and, most impressively, over thirty films. These works can appear low-tech and employ a seemingly simple means of shooting such as the use of a fixed camera angle. Although some of her films can be based loosely on a fictional or historical tale, the artist’s real power lies not in storytelling but in her adeptness with the medium of film itself.  Her narratives are deeply rooted in film’s relationship to light and time, and to the reflexive and circuitous nature of both these elements.Disappearance at Sea II is the title of a short film made after Disappearance at Sea (1996).  Both works take as their point of departure the story of Donald Crowhurst, an amateur yachtsman from England who joined the solo, round-the-world Sunday Times Golden Globe Race in 1968. The inexperienced (and, some might say, deceptive) Crowhurst quickly ran into difficulties, and eventually his craft, Teignmouth Electron, was found several hundred miles from the coast of Britain, abandoned.  Filmed in anamorphic format at St. Abb’s Head on the east coast of Scotland, Disappearance at Sea uses the light and lenses of a lighthouse and its surrounding landscape to suggestive narrative ends.The title Disappearance at Sea II—and especially the subtitle, Voyage de Guérison, which Dean added in her accompanying text—refer to the medieval legend of Tristan and Isolde’s misguided, love-potion-induced affair. Tristan, unlike Crowhurst, embraced the ocean’s power: after being mortally wounded, he allowed himself to drift in a voyage de guérison, or journey of healing, to a magical island where he hoped to be cured once again by the powers of Isolde and her mother, the queen. Dean set the film at the Longstone Lighthouse in the Farne Islands, mounting the camera on the building’s lighting apparatus.  Using an anamorphic lens, she limited her exploration to a single continuous shot, with the camera’s eye moving in the same trajectory as the lighthouse beam, seeing what it would normally iluminate. The uninterrupted rotation captures the reflections in the lighthouse’s curved windows, and through them, the surrounding sea and sky. During exhibition, the rhythmic clicking of the projector and film reel within the gallery echoes the sound of the rotating lighthouse within the film. This relationship is further complicated by the fact that the audio was not captured on location, but rather composed from the sound of a ventilator in a fish and chip shop, which was mixed with that of a short-wave radio transmission.Reflecting on Dean’s oeuvre, the novelist Jeannete Winterson wrote: “The vividness of her images and the vibrancy of her soundscapes are a challenge to the desensitized, coarse world of normal experience, where bright lights, movement and noise cheat us into believing that something is happening. Tacita Dean’s slow nothingness is far more rich and strange.” Indeed, in this artist’s work, real and cinematic space become analogous, forming an elegant symmetry between medium and subject.  Disappearance at Sea II, like its companion, is ultimately about the phenomenon of projection, of a beam of light being transmitted through a lens—in actuality, the essence of film.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/154482/disappearance-at-sea-ii

His improvisational approach is often defined by the handheld camera, distilled but coded actions, gestures, performative expressions, and restrained postproduction editing.In Girls, Tricky, McQueen portrayed the London-based experimental “trip-hop” musician and producer Tricky (born Adrian Thaws) as he rehearses a track in his dimly lit recording studio. Four days spent together in this confined space resulted in an intimate and sensitive representation of the singer. Of this experience, McQueen recalled:“I wanted to get as close to the artist as possible. He has this certain je ne sais quoi, like Marlon Brando or James Dean. Tricky possesses a certain spontaneity, which also influenced the film. Tricky is someone who entrusts himself to his own voice and tries to find out where it may carry him. It’s a rare moment that you see an artist close up gearing himself up for a vocal performance in such a visual way. In effect, a moment not for camera is caught.”Indeed, Tricky erupts into an ecstatic, frenzied performance over the course of nearly 15 minutes, yet by the end, it becomes clear that he has maintained command of both his senses and the recording session. Using extreme close-ups, very few cuts, and deliberately restricted lighting, McQueen captured the raw creative act in an intensely concentrated portrait, which is at once elusive, elliptical, and subtly transgressive.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/185194/girls-tricky

The teapot partly capitalized on the success of W. S. Gilbert and Sir Arthur Sullivan’s operetta Patience, a satire of the Aesthetic Movement that was first performed in 1881, the year the vessel was produced. Patience prominently featured a poet called Bunthorne, a caricature of writer and aesthete Oscar Wilde. Like Wilde, disciples of the Aesthetic Movement had specific ideas about the most beautiful flowers (sunflowers and calla lilies) and colors (purple), and they subscribed to the notion that by surrounding oneself with beautiful objects one would become beautiful.On the base of the teapot appear the words Fearful Consequences Through the Laws of Natural Selection & Evolution of Living up to One’s Teapot—an allusion to something Oscar Wilde said while he was a student at Oxford University in England: “I find it harder and harder every day to live up to my blue china.” The teapot’s base is a double-edged satire, mocking Wilde’s overwrought attention to all things aesthetic, as well as Darwin’s newly introduced theory of natural selection, which was scoffed at for its implication that humans descended from apes. Taking Wilde’s quip to its logical conclusion, the young man and woman on the teapot have so successfully lived up to their china that they have literally morphed into a teapot.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/202468/teapot

This cabinet is decorated in a style similar to the Infantado suite, in red and gold japanning, the English name for imitation lacquer.The cabinet combines some classical elements, like the broken pediment and flame-like finials at the top, with chinoiserie (Chinese-inspired) figures and scenes done in gold and silver.

Hepworth incorporated the totemic aspect of these prehistoric monumets in works such as this, while also seeking what she described as “some absolute essence in sculptural terms giving the quality of human relationships.” Here, she used her signature technique of piercing carved wood and highlighting the cavities with paint. Hepworth’s fluid use of negative and positive space draws attention to both the surface and the interior forms.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/65839/two-figures-menhirs

In order to create such sequences, he set up a battery of cameras, 24 in this instance, connected by a clockwork mechanism that triggered the shutters one by one at rhythmic intervals. Muybridge initially devised this process to clarify the movement of horses; through his experiments, he demonstrated that all four hooves leave the ground mid-gallop, thereby settling an intense debate of the era. This print of a cockatoo in flight was originally published in Animal Locomotion, a portfolio of 781 separate series that Muybridge, working under the auspices of the University of Pennsylvania, created to stand at the intersection of art and science.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/195560/animal-locomotion-plate-758

He spent March through June 1855 with the troops, producing 360 wet-plate glass negatives in his horse-drawn darkroom. The laborious process and lengthy exposure times precluded photographs of battle, yet Fenton captured the psychological intensity of war in pictures such as The Valley of the Shadow of Death. A superficial sense of barren calm is belied by the numerous Russian cannonballs, which cover the ground to indicate past violence and suggest imminent future danger in the area. Fenton exhibited this and related images in London in the fall of 1855, provoking enormous public interest, and he published them in portfolio editions.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/123407/the-valley-of-the-shadow-of-death

Made in England in the mid-18th century, it has a hinged top so that it could be placed against a wall when not in use.The table is made of mahogany, which was imported to England from Central America and the West Indies. The dense and fine-grained nature of the wood made it suitable for carving in relief, as can be seen in the virtuoso carving of the table’s freize and legs. The legs have been shaped as rams’ heads with scrolling horns in high relief and swags of vines suspended from their mouths. Like goats, rams were traditionally associated with Bacchus, the Roman god of wine, and thus revelry, indicating that the table was probably intended for a dining room or banquet room.18th-century English furniture is rarely marked or labeled, even on pieces of the highest quality, like this one. Although the names of several cabinetmakers have been proposed, it remains difficult, if not impossible, to attribute the table to a particular designer or workshop.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/180742/center-table

For Blake, Urizen’s laws limited energy and crushed the imagination.Here, Blake depicts Urizen as a bearded old man crouching beneath a large rock, adhering closely to the following verses from The Book of Urizen: “And a roof, vast petrific around, / On all sides He fram’d: like a womb.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/151451/urizen

Several of the dukes enriched the beauty of the house. For example, the 4th Duke commissioned a suite of chinoiserie furniture from the fashionable London cabinet makers John and William Linnell in 1754, which became famous enough to influence future projects. Similarly, the 4th Duke’s son, who became the 5th Duke of Beaufort in 1756 when he was only twelve years old, wasted no time in making additions of his own to Badminton when he reached his majority. In his account books for 1782 appears the following entry: “February 23 to Wm France Library Ladder 16 Pounds 11s.” The reference is to the London cabinetmaker William France, Jr., whose father had set up a significant cabinetmaking shop next door to Thomas Chippendale’s in St. Martin’s Lane in the 1760s.As a graduate of Oxford with a doctorate in civil law, the 5th Duke lavished much attention on the library at Badminton, including this library ladder.

Yet Pether waited for a successful review of the 1766 painting for A Philosopher Giving a Lecture on the Orrery before he began the laborious mezzotint process, completing it only in 1768.

Watts’s composite approach gives the work a powerful and experimental quality, which is enhanced by the presence of mold marks. Plaster casts were made from piece molds that left mold lines after casting. Normally these would have been smoothed away, but Watts chose to leave them here.

In the 1930s, Moore merged his interest in non-Western art with aspects of abstraction and Surrealism, which he encountered during his regular trips to Paris. Works like Figure reveal Moore’s engagement with the organic, biomorphic forms used by contemporary Surrealist artists such as Jean Arp, Alberto Giacometti, and Joan Miró.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/72900/figure

Tapestry weaving is slow and therefore expensive, which made such textiles inaccessible to most consumers.The hanging of Pomona, the goddess of orchards and gardens, was paired with another tapestry depicting Flora, the goddess of flowering plants. The first version of this pair was woven in the mid-1880s with a bold background of large leaves designed by William Morris. Smaller versions were later produced with the millefleurs design in the background by John Henry Dearle. The floral background resulted in a more harmonious composition, as Dearle’s smaller flowers were better suited to the delicate rendering of the goddesses.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/76634/pomona

Between 1839 and 1843, Talbot made at least 47 separate images of Patroclus alone, plus several others in which the bust was an element.

Brilliantly lit, her ecstatic face appears to be emerging from darkness.

eng_337,Lucia Moholy,Gelatin silver print,Florence Henri,"In 1923 Lucia Moholy, who had studied photographic technique in the previous decade, began a photography apprenticeship at the Bauhaus, where her husband, László Moholy-Nagy, had recently been appointed instructor. She quickly adopted a modernist approach focused on portraiture and architectural views. Lucia Moholy believed that the face and hands conveyed the true character of a sitter, and she made a series of portrait pairs in the 1920s isolating these two parts of the body. During her five years at the Bauhaus, Moholy also chronicled the German art school’s buildings, design products, faculty, and student body. French-American artist Florence Henri took a summer painting course at the Bauhaus, but on her return to France she abandoned her brush for the camera; Moholy photographed her several times during the course of their friendship. This close-cropped, direct portrait fits with the sobriety of the growing New Objectivity movement in photography and painting, and it echoes a vogue for close-up film stills that had just begun in Germany.— Permanent collection labelFormally trained in reproduction photography, Lucia Moholy worked at the Bauhaus as a documentarian of its myriad productions—from architectural projects to modern design objects. With the spare aesthetic that she used in documentary photographs, Moholy also made portraits of Bauhaus students and friends, some as publicity but others, including this work, for more personal ends. Moholy often utilized plain backgrounds and preferred her subjects to be closely cropped in an asymmetrical balance. This approach is evident in her view of Florence Henri, who came to Dessau in 1927 to audit courses in painting. Henri benefited from Moholy’s expertise and the general Bauhaus proclivity toward photography; after moving to Paris, she too concentrated on camera work, especially portraiture.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/50171/florence-henri

He had bought it for 150 guineas directly from the artist’s studio, along with Wright’s Academy by Lamplight.

Whistler was struggling financially and hoped that the sale of the print would generate funds at the same time that he was using the painting itself as collateral against badly needed loans. A process that reached its apogee in 18th-century England, mezzotint printmaking involves a subtractive process of burnishing away the rough surface of a metal plate gradually to reveal highlights. The subtle gradations of black and gray that Josey could achieve using this medium reinforced Whistler’s harmonic composition of muted tones.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/28594/arrangement-in-grey-and-black-no-1-portrait-of-the-artist-s-mother

Growing up in the working-class town of Wigan, near Manchester in northern England, the artist spent much of his leisure time as a train-spotter; this enthusiasm has motivated his exploration of time structures and transportation systems––clocks and trains appear often in his work. Not unlike the physicist Albert Einstein, who coincidentally used the example of a clock on a train to explain the space-time continuum, Almond explores the ways in which these seemingly fixed factors are in fact reciprocal and relative.The first of a trilogy of short films based on trains, Schwebebahn features one of the oldest, most unusual, and still notably efficient public transportation systems in the world: the suspended monorail system in Wuppertal, Germany, built between 1898 and 1901. Using a handheld Super 8 camera and shooting from several vantage points within the train cars, Almond produced footage that was, as Martin Herbert described it, “Inverted, reversed, and retarded … so that the train appeared to be above the rail and the landscape below appeared to be above and upside-down. In slow-motion, the experience of riding the rails… became a kind of suspended animation in a parallel universe.” In Almond’s disorienting world, the viewer’s experience of gravity and perception is unbalanced: the horizon is misleading, and time and movement are cyclical, reversed. This defamiliarizing sensation is further heightened by a soundtrack of hypnotic electronic music.The two other films in the trilogy are Geisterbahn, or Ghost Train (1999), which documents a shadowy ride through a haunted house in Vienna that was rebuilt after World War II, and In the Between (2006), a three-screen projective installation that follows the recently opened railway from Xining, China, to Lhasa, Tibet, with symbolic vignettes from each of the once completely isolated areas. Throughout his oeuvre, Almond acknowledges the passing of time and its inevitable consequences, whatever they may be. Without judgment, he creates poetic comparisons between our analog past and the increasing speed of the digital age.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/159651/schwebebahn

This series enthusiastically embraced J. M. W. Turner’s “historical” category from the Liber Studiorum (1807–1819). Yet “Mad” Martin eschewed Turner’s sepia tonality for a deep, velvet black periodically ripped asunder by lightning bolts. He engraved over 100 mezzotints, with special attention paid to the light and dark contrasts of Old Testament miracles and disasters. Although the series remained unfinished, his taste for elaborate destruction was sometimes well remunerated: when his gigantic oil painting Belshazzar’s Feast (1821; private collection) was put on view soon after being made, it attracted 50,000 paying viewers.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/118022/moses-and-the-burning-bush-from-illustrations-of-the-bible

In 1929, Moholy-Nagy was appointed the set designer at the Kroll Opera House, and produced several avant-garde sets employing translucent and perforated materials that would allow light to act as a sculptural element in the production. For Madame Butterfly, he constructed a Japanese house with sliding walls that could be transformed by light and movement.

He trained under his French-born father, the architect Augustus Charles Pugin, an authority on medieval buildings. A devout convert to Roman Catholicism in a predominantly Anglican country, the younger Pugin proselytized through his architectural work and in a series of publications issued between 1835 and 1843. For Pugin, the Gothic style expressed the faith and conviction of the Middle Ages and was a necessary counter to the increasing secularism and industrialization of his own time. In addition to chapels and churches, he also designed the liturgical equipment, altars, hangings, and vestments within them. Pugin also adapted the Gothic Revival style for his secular commissions, which included the Houses of Parliament in London.This chalice was designed by Pugin and produced by the workshop of Hardiman & Company, a firm retained by the architect to make metal implements and fittings for his commissions. The word MODEL is inscribed on its underside, which suggests that the vessel served as a sample to be shown to potential clients. Final, commissioned versions of the chalice would be handcrafted by goldsmiths in precious metals and gemstones, rather than die-struck in Sheffield plate, the silver-plated copper that was commonly used for ordinary metal work.— About This Object, European Decorative Arts LaunchPad app",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/63525/model-chalice

Cameron became enthralled with what she called “the primitive simplicity of the inhabitants,” although she concentrated on only a few models—the Tamil women posing here were most likely maidservants working on her plantation.

eng_393,Gary Hume,Enamel paint on aluminum panel,Yellow Angels,"Gary Hume extends the tenets of high Modernist painting by creating flat, decorative compositions with imagery drawn from everyday life. While the subjects of his paintings are recognizable and sometimes ordinary, they are presented schematically, in silhouette form and without detail. They are always enigmatic, entirely lacking narrative or sentiment.Hume emerged with a generation of young British artists, many of whom studied at Goldsmith’s College and were featured in Damien Hirst’s legendary Freeze exhibition in the late 1980s. This three-part exhibition was held in an abandoned warehouse in South London, but gained immediate international attention and catapulted the careers of several artists, Hume prominent among them. His contribution to the exhibition was a series of monochromatic canvases painted with high gloss enamel, resembling the swinging doors found in municipal buildings and hospitals. The artist continued to develop the door motif paintings until 1993, when he abruptly changed his painting style. Throughout the 1990s, the artist painted compositions of multi-layered images drawn from British popular culture, everyday life, and nature.In Yellow Angels the artist has abandoned his silhouette format for a looser, more calligraphic style. Delineated and entangled hot-pink forms slide across the acid yellow surface of the composition. Reminiscent of his earlier work, Hume’s color scheme is slick and garish. Here, as always, the artist’s creative process begins with sketches of images taken from books and magazines that he then projects and traces onto canvas or aluminum. This painting is particularly significant in the context of Hume’s recent work: the first in a new series of large-format paintings, it has generated an entire suite of figurative works (many of which include the angel motif) featured in a solo exhibition at Whitechapel Art Gallery in London in 1999.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/154483/yellow-angels

This exploratory sketch by Constable is one of his earliest and largest studies of trees and was probably drawn in Dedham Vale, the area of rolling hills and woods surrounding his home on the border of Essex and Suffolk. Hallmarks of Constable’s technique can be observed here, especially the indistinct description of foliage contrasted with sharply delineated trunks and branches. When viewing one of Constable’s studies of trees, William Blake stated, “Why, this is no drawing, but inspiration.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/207789/a-stand-of-elm-trees-recto-a-study-of-east-bergholt-with-the-church-verso
eng_417,Thomas Hope (Maker),"Mahogany, ebony, beech, and leather upholstery",Chair,"When Thomas Hope published his book Household Furniture and Interior Decoration in 1807, his name became forever associated with Neoclassicalism. Hope was a connoisseur and collector from a wealthy banking family of Scottish origin that moved from Amsterdam to London after the French Revolution. As a young man, he traveled extensively throughout Europe, Turkey, Syria, and Egypt, acquiring objects from all of these places, and incorporating elements from them in his design work. Hope’s wish was to shape the taste of his time by commissioning cabinetmakers to produce objects, most of which he designed himself, for display in his London home. His mansion on Duchess Street became a showplace visited by art lovers and professional architects who took inspiration from his work.Of all the forms illustrated in Hope’s influential book, seating received the most attention. This chair, originally intended for use in a room containing Classical vases, is based on the saber-legged klismos, an ancient Greek form. Its idiosyncratic profile, with the exaggerated concave/convex shapes of the vertical stiles, might well have been inspired by the chairs depicted on the pots that sat on the shelves directly above it.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/199775/chair

Such scenes are reminiscent of the 18th-century British fashion for ornamental farms and dairies within elite society, similar to Marie Antoinette’s 1783 Hamlet at Versailles, with its imported Swiss sheep and cows.

His mother, the goddess Thetis, emerges from a rocky outcropping at right, her arms spread in grief. In the distance, the airborne hero’s spirit rides his shield to the afterlife.

In Victorian England, amateur photography required a knowledge of chemistry and optics, funds to purchase equipment and chemicals, and ample leisure time to experiment. Happy accidents often resulted in these early photographs, such as the appearance here of a two-headed cat, the result of the cat moving its head during the lengthy exposure demanded by early photographic technology.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/34883/mrs-craik-holding-cat

Muybridge conducted a massive project of recording motion at the University of Pennsylvania from 1884 to 1886.

Scholars have confirmed that Talbot took 10 or more views of chess players, yet this one—likely of noted photographer Antoine Claudet and Talbot’s assistant Nicolaas Henneman—may not be his. This print and other variants of the same scene are unsigned, and on a different paper from Talbot’s normal stock. Recent scholarship posits that the images might have been made in Claudet’s studio before ending up in Henneman’s possession; this print could have entered Talbot’s holdings when Henneman gave him prints as payment toward a debt.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/27083/the-chess-players

Little of Vile’s work is documented, apart from the pieces he made between 1761 and 1764 for his most important patrons, King George III and Queen Charlotte. While records survive describing many of the pieces made for the royal collection, it has not been possible to match this cabinet with any of those objects.Elongated cabriole legs of solid carved mahogany support the cabinet, which is veneered with quartered mahogany, framed by ebony moldings, and bordered by carved Rococo relief ornament. This relief work and the galleried superstructure are painted, probably to simulate ivory.

The arms emerging from the ground belong to the prophetess with whom Odin consults.

The medium allowed the artist to achieve new textural effects, especially when copying from paintings. His large-scale Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire was originally painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds. To obtain a rich painterly texture, Green used a uniquely fine-toothed “rocker,” a tool that roughened the surface of the entire plate, producing a particularly dark overall ink tone when it was printed. The tones were then burnished and scraped to produce the white heightening of the image. The resulting composition exudes the refinement and soft elegance that only Green could produce. He printed close to 400 mezzotints during his career; all appeared in limited editions, which was made necessary by the delicacy of his plates.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/52928/georgiana-duchess-of-devonshire

Wilding later recalled of Wong, “When I lifted her hands to ‘drape’ them, they were so fragile that one felt one was holding the most delicate snowdrops.” This photograph was taken around the time that Wong’s mother had died in a tragic car accident, and may have served not as a typical publicity photograph, but rather as a portrait of grief.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/137078/anna-may-wong

Hobbema’s works show a desire to present landscape as an idyllic environment, ordered and regulated by man, an idea that spoke to Earlom, as is clear in many of his own orderly landscapes and market scenes.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/76103/river-and-rural-scene

It was an era that saw the emergence of distinctly modern forms of cultural consumption: romances, sentimental novels and, most important, Gothic novels and plays focusing on themes of terror and the supernatural.

Talbot used this image to extol the practical virtues of the new art, claiming that “the whole cabinet of a Virtuoso and collector of old China might be depicted on paper in little more time than it would take him to make a written inventory describing it in the usual way.” Moreover, he argued presciently, if a thief should take the treasures, such an image could provide a new kind of evidentiary record in court.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/227552/articles-of-china

In 1917, in the Yorkshire village of Cottingley, two girls decided to play a little trick on their parents, and created what they claimed was photographic evidence of fairies dancing. The pictures attracted the attention of Arthur Conan Doyle who, despite the scientific skepticism manifested in his Sherlock Holmes stories, was an ardent believer in spiritism. In the summer of 1920, at Doyle’s request, the girls took—that is, made—three more photographs (this is the first). Doyle deemed them authentic, and published the photographs (calling Frances “Alice”) to worldwide interest. Only decades later was the secret revealed: the girls had copied drawings from an illustrated children’s book, cut out the pictures, and held them in place with hat pins. Although they now seem obvious fakes, a willing public believed in the inherent veracity of photography and its ability to see things that are beyond the scope of normal vision.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/209688/alice-and-leaping-fairy

The third is not only a smaller pattern but also shows a great deal more vegetation than the other two versions. Thus, there are represented three separate engravings of the same scene. William Penn (1644- 1718) was a prominent English Quaker leader and the founder of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

This candlelight subject does not immediately appear subversive: a young woman holding a candlestick reaches over the flame toward a bookshelf above. Yet the woman is likely not the mistress of the house, judging from her maidservant attire, though she selects a book rather than dusting the shelf. At the time it was considered improper for women to do reading, serious or otherwise, and so the title juxtaposes lucubration—meaning serious, nocturnal study by artificial light—with an unexpected modifier, female. Indeed, she seems to be anticipating reading something illicit, perhaps the 18th-century erotic novel Fanny Hill, or Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/76102/female-lucubration-etude-nocturne

In this case, he copied Rembrandt van Rijn’s distinctively posed, stoic rabbi. Mezzotint was an ideal medium with which to reproduce Rembrandt’s composition, with its dramatic, Baroque use of chiaroscuro. Not only does mezzotint retain these qualities, but its rich undertones also add to the spotlighted effects. With a touch of theatricality, the portrait focuses on his craggy features.

This event took place in 1306 in the Franciscan monastery in Dumfries, Scotland. Fuseli places the swaggering Robert front stage, nonchalantly resheathing his sword. In the background, the dying Comyn has collapsed in the arms of the friars.The figure of Robert—whose exaggerated musculature was inspired by both ancient Roman sculpture and Michelangelo—is seen from slightly below, emphasizing his dominance.

Talbot held artistic aspirations, but he was also interested in the myriad scientific and commercial applications for photography. He hoped that his photographs of lace, for example, might make it easier to copy intricate patterns and thus facilitate manufacturing. The negative for this print was likely made by laying a fragment of lace upon a piece of photosensitized paper and exposing it to the sun, without the aid of a camera.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/27066/%E6%85%8C%E6%95%A3

His efforts were not entirely successful; Catherine the Great, the empress of Russia, eventually acquired the entirety of Walpole’s holdings.

Paul before Felix, showing the apostle’s self-defense, was commissioned for the chapel of Lincoln’s Inn, where lawyers were admitted to the bar.

eng_818,,"Mahogany, brass, ivory, and glass",Bookcase,"This imposing bookcase is one of a set of four designed for Rokeby Park in County Durham, England. Rokeby was the home of Sir Thomas Robinson, an amateur architect, and the form of these bookcases relates directly to designs that he drew up himself.Rokeby Park was built in 1725–30 and further decorated around the middle of the 18th century, but it literally rests on ancient history, as the land was once the site of a Roman encampment. The house is in the Palladian tradition: it was influenced by the work of the 16th-century Venetian architect Andrea Palladio, who was in turn inspired by Classical architecture, specifically the formal temple designs of the Greeks and Romans. This classicism carries over into the bookcase in the horizontal borders at the cornice and above the drawers; they are carved with egg-and-dart motifs, ultimately derived from ancient Greek architecture, and Vitruvian scroll borders, named for the ancient Roman architect Vitruvius.Bookcases are, of course, designed to hold books, but they can also display precious objects: this bookcase may have shown off items made of porcelain, which had only recently begun to be made in Europe. The choice of mahogany is also an indication of the owner’s wealth and status—it was a luxurious material that was imported from the Americas. In 1769 Rokeby Park was purchased from Sir Thomas Robinson by John Sawrey Morritt. It was most likely at this time that the Robinson coat of arms on the bookcase was changed to the Morritt coat of arms, which were then engraved into the lock plates on the doors.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/65384/bookcase

While sketching from a live model was part of conventional practice, copying ancient Roman sculpture was equally important. Fuseli’s exposure to an abundance of ancient sculpture during his years in Rome (1770–78) became a visual catalogue he drew upon throughout his life.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/113809/figure-studies-recto-and-verso

Though a testimony to the heroism and sacrifice of Canadian soldiers, these prints also testify to the violent plague of destruction brought about by war. The 13th-century Saint Martin Cathedral was badly damaged during the war, leaving only the nave standing, as shown in the background of this image. The second battle of Ypres, Belgium, marked the first major engagement for the Canadian military in World War I. After a four-day battle consisting of multiple rounds of chlorine-gas exposure and counterattacks, Canadian soldiers successfully held their ground until British troops arrived. Barely noticeable in the foreground of this scene are soldiers pulling bodies out of the rubble.

Fenton spent the spring of 1855 in the Crimea under extremely trying conditions, making about 350 pictures over the course of three and a half months. Scenes of active battle were impossible to capture given the limitations of photographic technology at the time, and Fenton also restrained from portraying the bodies of dead soldiers.

Alessandro Mastro-Valerio’s search for the ideal printmaking medium likely culminated in seeing a similar work during his inspiring visit to the Century of Progress Exposition in 1933.

While in the Eternal City, Flaxman produced this study for a nine-by-five-foot bas-relief using several references from ancient Roman sculpture. The drawing exhibits Flaxman’s signature elegance in figural outlines. However, Flaxman felt the project was inadequate to establish his reputation as a sculptor, so he abandoned it and later reused two of the figures from this drawing in a different context.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/217215/amphion-and-zethus-delivering-their-mother-antiope-from-the-fury-of-dirce-and-lycus

An almost obsessive use of vertical ink hatching reminiscent of printmaking (in which Jefferys was trained) is accompanied by broad passages of brown wash to establish location and mood. While the artist occasionally uses light brown wash for modeling, for the most part the flesh of his strongly outlined nude figures is defined by the untouched cream-colored paper.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/238624/nude-male-figures-bearing-the-bodies-of-their-dead-companions

Handling an unwieldy stretch of paper sized just to the reach of his arms, Beshty crumpled, folded, and otherwise manipulated his material in the darkroom while selectively exposing it to light. The resulting patterns are random, beautiful, and transparently expressive of the artist’s considerable physical effort. Photographic materials and procedures are specific elements to be borne in mind by the viewer. In keeping with his emphasis on revelation and physical presence, Beshty dates all his works with this title to the year of their first public presentation, which in this case took place in 2011.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/211704/picture-made-by-my-hand-with-the-assistance-of-light

He created innovative designs for everything from chandeliers, electric lamps, and fireplace accessories to such newly invented modern conveniences as the electric kettle. Rather than relying on elaborate decoration for effect, Benson took advantage of the inherent reflective qualities of his materials.

At first Moore refused; however, soon after he himself had to hide in an underground subway tunnel during a German bombing raid, he accepted Clark’s offer. Moore’s first government assignment was to capture graphically the fear, pain, and anguish he witnessed in the tunnels, resulting in a powerful series of bomb-shelter drawings.By the end of summer 1941, Moore’s interest in producing shelter drawings had waned, and his friend Herbert Read, a philosopher and writer, suggested he depict coal miners who, because their work was crucial to the war effort, were called “Britain’s Underground Army.” The son of a miner, Moore felt an immediate connection to this new subject, and he returned to his hometown, Castleford, to begin the series. Years later he described the brutality of mining conditions: “If one were to describe what Hell might be like, this would do.” After completing one sketchbook in the mine, Moore returned to his studio, where he filled two additional notebooks with images of miners; the Art Institute’s drawings were removed from one such book.Moore’s concentration on miners allowed him to focus on two themes he had not yet explored : men and the figure in motion. Previously, he had depicted principally women and children and the figure at rest. This shift is illustrated in this sketch; constricted to narrow, low tunnels, ranged one above the other, miners walk, bend, and use picks and shovels. Though his figures are not static, Moore acknowledged that their actions were so constrained by the space so that they could use only the top half of their bodies: “the lower part is stuck [to the floor of the mine] as it were to the pedestal.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/150822/miners

A complete fan would have boasted the three earlier scenes on the other side; indeed, the folds in the paper suggest the impression may once have been fitted for use.

Equally impressive was his ability to depict the paintings; many remain quite recognizable, and he rendered them with considerable detail and tonal nuance.

His evocative etching and mezzotint print series, the Liber Studiorum (1807–19), was just as influential. Printed in sepia lines and tonal areas evoking Old Master drawing ink and modeling, Turner’s series of 71 prints is an extended ode to the landscape. The letters above each work designate the subject type, including architectural (A), pastoral (P) and elevated pastoral (EP), and historical (H), marine (M), and mountainous (M). Turner’s exhaustive categories inspired John Constable to produce a further-specialized mezzotint series of 22 English landscapes.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/71703/mer-de-glace-plate-50-from-liber-studiorum

R. Way oversaw the printing of most of Whistler’s lithographs, which often involved the direct participation of Whistler himself. The Ways were champions of lithography and sought to have it recognized as an art form, not just as an affordable means of reproducing images. Unlike etching and mezzotint, both of which are intaglio processes requiring the incision of a metal plate, lithographic printing relies more on chemistry and the basic principle that oil and water repel each other. As this example demonstrates, a lithograph can be characterized by a powdery or chalky surface texture. Whistler, together with Way, frequently used this quality to achieve expressive effects.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/29386/arrangement-in-grey-and-black-portrait-of-the-artist-s-mother-after-whistler

Evans was elected to the Linked Ring, a London Pictorialist group, in 1900. That year, Evans abandoned the meticulous, sharp style of his architectural views and instead took up portraiture employing a painterly, soft focus, which he had formerly used in landscapes. On July 1, 1900, Evans was present for the private London performance of Candida, a daring play written by his close friend George Bernard Shaw six years earlier. At this event he photographed the enterprising young actor Harley Granville Barker in character as the poet Eugene Marchbanks, who competes for the affections of the play’s title character, the wife of a clergyman. Unusual for Evans, this picture emphasizes the shape of the figure, and the background has been all but removed through close vertical cropping.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/47097/h-granville-barker-in-character

After about a decade spent documenting church architecture, he completed his last major series at the Durham Cathedral, in the north of England, between 1911 and 1912.

This print by William Wynne Ryland is a copy of a drawing by François Boucher, now in the British Museum, that was once owned by well-known collector William Esdaile.Ryland’s studies of crayon-manner engraving in Paris inspired him to develop a simplified version he called stipple engraving, in which a series of dots are punched into a metal plate with a sharp needle tool. Although stipple engraving did not catch on at this time, it gained popularity in the late 18th and early 19th centuries as a means to reproduce the varying tonalities of paintings.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/13894/bathsheba-from-a-collection-of-prints-in-imitation-of-drawings

He spent March through June 1855 with the troops, producing 350 wet-plate glass negatives in his horse-drawn darkroom; they were later shown in exhibitions and published in portfolios for purchase. Because of technical limitations and his presumed upper-end clientele, these earliest images of war do not depict death and battle, but rather portraits of officers and scenes of ships, tents, and supplies, as seen here.

Ridiculing the puritan party’s attempts to overthrow the British monarchy during the Great Civil War of 1640, Butler’s poem exposes the hypocrisy and pretensions of the Presbyterians, Independents, and Zealots who hoped to establish themselves as leaders.Here, Hudibras takes on more than he can handle in the person of a rather large woman called Trulla, who insists on restoring the fiddle player to liberty.

Like other Victorian amateurs, he found himself attracted to the picturesque ruins of the British countryside, such as the ancient Whitby Abbey, which had become a popular tourist destination. Turner made several images there, publishing six in an album entitled Photographic Views from Nature, which featured sixty photographs made between 1852 and 1854. Turner employed the paper negative process, which had the risk of overexposing very light areas, such as the sky, while underexposing the shadows; here, he solved the problem by presenting the sky as interesting shapes framed by the bones of the church. The paper negative’s slight texture, however, was otherwise well-suited to its subject, allowing Turner to evoke more effectively the roughly textured character of hewn stone.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/100306/whitby

During this time, mezzotint was primarily used to translate oil paintings into printed form rather than for original expression. This portrait of Lady Bampfydle exemplifies the delicate uses of half tones to convey rich texture and depth. Reynolds’s model contributes its witty adaptation in reverse of the famous antique Venus de’ Medici.

Paul before Felix, showing the apostle’s self-defense, was commissioned for the chapel of Lincoln’s Inn, where lawyers were admitted to the bar.

Venus and Cupid is a highly finished study for a relief sculpture of the same subject (now in the Cliffe Castle Museum in Yorkshire). Consistent with his profession, Deare’s drawing technique is characterized by severe linearity, minimal shading, and a frieze-like arrangement of figures, as though the whole were carved from a block of stone.Cupid holds an outsize butterfly, an allusion to his wedding to Psyche. In Neoplatonic philosophy, the butterfly signifies the immortality of the soul. Gazing intensely into Cupid’s eyes, Venus expresses maternal affection while at the same time registering an erotic charge.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/241061/venus-and-cupid
eng_1434,Grinling Gibbons,Limewood,"Overmantel and Cornice from Great House in Cassiobury Park, Hertfordshire","Flowers in the home made a grand statement in 17th century Northern Europe, where year-round cultivation was difficult and expensive. Influenced by potted plants and live garlands, Anglo-Dutch artists decked luxurious interiors with year-round floral displays sculpted in wood. This fashion was led by sculptor Grinling Gibbons, who devised a technique of carving layers of linden wood in highly naturalistic detail to be applied in rhythmic masses of flowers over doorways and picture frames above fireplaces as overmantels.This overmantel is from Cassiobury House, the home of the Earls of Essex, where it ornamented a room of proportions similar to the display gallery. The sheet music crowned by a wreath near the center may refer to the room’s original purpose as a cabinet for entertainment; ironically, it notates not a profound composition but instead a simple tune, “Twas Woman Mad Me Love.” This page is taken directly from a popular beginner’s book on playing the recorder, published in London in 1683.The overmantel has undergone many changes throughout its life, having witnessed numerous renovations and additions to Cassiobury before arriving at the Art Institute in 1926, just prior to the grand home’s demolition. After two years of careful conservation, cleaning, and re-carving of some lost elements, it has been reassembled to better reflect its state at the time of its original installation. The carved basket, which was at one point incorporated into the overmantel, was possibly made for another room or displayed above the chimney breast.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/28770/overmantel-and-cornice-from-great-house-in-cassiobury-park-hertfordshire

Lithography depends upon the antipathy of grease and water, so a lithographer draws on a smooth block of limestone in a greasy medium—crayon or a liquid wash called tusche. When printing ink is applied to the wet stone, it only sticks to the drawn lines. The first collection of lithographs, or polyautographs, Specimens of Polyautography, was published in London in 1801 with pen lithographs by several well-known English artists. After this early start, lithography failed to catch on in England, however, leaving French artists to explore the full range of possibilities of the medium.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/41780/landscape

A note attached to this drawing indicates that it was made on a walk from one town to another on July 25, 1868.

Conceived and choreographed by Trisha Brown, a founder of the postmodern dance movement, Man Walking Down the Side of a Building was performed by Joseph Schlichter, a dancer and Brown’s husband at the time. Schlichter slowly descended the seven-story building where they lived, suspended perpendicular to its facade by a harness and cables. Making a simple, ordinary movement such as walking strenuously technical (“a natural activity under the stress of an unnatural setting,” as she put it), Brown collapsed distinctions between dance and performance art. This ephemeral act was memorialized by Peter Moore, who would become known for his photographs of avant-garde performances in New York in the late 1960s through the 1980s.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/239457/joseph-schlichter-performing-man-walking-down-the-side-of-a-building-by-trisha-brown-80-wooster-st

eng_1520,Graphic Thought Facility (Designer),Paper,Gavin Turk New Art Close-Up 2,"Cohesive layouts and modular frameworks provide the underpinning of an identity in a publication series. Each of these three series illustrates different frameworks employed by the British graphic design firms Graphic Thought Facility (GTF) and A Practice for Everyday Life (APFEL). Identical elements such as the use of typeface, color, and layout combined with unique components such as photography or color to distinguish one edition from another are featured in each series. British-based GTF used a unique, folded tab cover that shapes the framework of design for the New Art Up-Close series on internationally known living artists. The tabs hold the information of the publication—the title on the front cover and the description and ISBN number on the back cover. Behind the tabs, full bleed prints of the artist’s work fill the front cover with a portrait of the artist on the back. In the Exhibition Histories series, the approach by APFEL is straightforward, with a consistent layout and typeface; each edition is distinguished by a unique color for the text and spine. The Happy Hypocrite, also designed by APFEL, unifies the varied full-bleed graphics that wrap each cover with the same placement and typeface for the title of each book. However, the fifth edition diverges from this format—the title of the book is enlarged and wraps around to the back cover as part of the background image, yet still retains essential components of the framework to identify with the series. These designers use multiple approaches to insert distinguishing characteristics in order to develop unique editions within a unified series.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/193490/gavin-turk-new-art-close-up-2

Hogarth created The Bathos toward the end of his life. It is considered one of the bleakest artworks of the 18th century because it depicts the Apocalypse without an afterlife. The Angel of Death even collapses in exhaustion after having destroyed the world.

He spent some 20 years photographing French and English cathedrals, working meticulously “to suggest the vastness, the grandeur of mass, the leading on from element to element, that so fascinates one in going through a cathedral.” For his views of the medieval Ely Cathedral in Cambridgeshire, Evans requested that all modern furniture and fixtures be removed. At a time when most artist-photographers manipulated their prints to achieve a painterly effect, Evans preferred to stage a scene “naturally,” then to create straightforward images and print them in platinum, which gives more precise visual information. Despite this, Pictorialist organizations and artists embraced his work. The Linked Ring, a British Pictorialist society, elected him to join their ranks, and Alfred Stieglitz featured Evans’s cathedral views in Camera Work, making Evans the first English contributor to that American publication.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/47896/interior-of-ely-cathedral

The British ruled large parts of India through the East India Company, a corporation with its own private armies and governmental functions. Tripe rose through the ranks of the Company’s army and began to experiment with photography in the early 1850s, photographing temples and other Indian monuments. In 1855, James Broun-Ramsay, the British governor general of India, commissioned him to join a diplomatic mission to Burma as its official photographer to document architecture and points of interest. When the complete series was exhibited in 1857, the jury called the photographs “excellent; remarkable for great distinctness and also for their unusual and beautiful tint.” In this photograph of the famous Buddhist Dhammayangyi temple, four disciples of Guatama Buddha are seated with lotus flowers as their footstools.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/216582/no-23-pugahm-myo-pagan-figures-in-damayangyee-pagoda-dhamma-yan-gyi

In the Exhibition Histories series, the approach by APFEL is straightforward, with a consistent layout and typeface; each edition is distinguished by a unique color for the text and spine. The Happy Hypocrite, also designed by APFEL, unifies the varied full-bleed graphics that wrap each cover with the same placement and typeface for the title of each book. However, the fifth edition diverges from this format—the title of the book is enlarged and wraps around to the back cover as part of the background image, yet still retains essential components of the framework to identify with the series. These designers use multiple approaches to insert distinguishing characteristics in order to develop unique editions within a unified series.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/216596/from-conceptualism-to-feminism-lucy-lippard-s-numbers-shows-1969-74-from-the-exhibition-histories-series

A friend and admirer of Roussel, he was also a collector of his prints and paintings, and around 1902 even helped print some impressions of Roussel’s color etchings. This drypoint image of Gotto— shown in an early state—was made around the same time as Roussel’s dramatic self-portrait.

A member of the Photo-Secession in the United States as well as the pictorialist Brotherhood of the Linked Ring in England, Coburn embraced handcrafted prints and the elevation of photography to an art. He often took the city as subject, achieving a painterly effect through the use of blurring, as in this plate from his portfolio London. Coburn produced photogravures—a method of printing a photograph in ink that registers a rich variety of tones—for a limited-edition portfolio and, because of the care he took with each reproduction, considered them fine art prints in their own right. Coburn’s photographs were meant to accompany an essay by Arthur Symons, but the images and text were ultimately published separately.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/44616/kingsway

He began to practice street photography by roaming Manhattan’s neighborhoods and capturing inhabitants’ unguarded expressions. Following his studies, he carried this approach back to England, where he turned an anthropological eye to the British at play. He was especially attracted to the eccentric leisurely activities of people living in seaside towns and islands, which were still relatively uninfluenced by modernization. In 1967 Ray-Jones toured these towns, including Douglas on the Isle of Man, where residents sunbathed with unusual choices of location or clothing.

Contemporary sources described him as mentally ill, “childish” or “unbalanced,” while others believed him to be a holy figure. Here John Young simplifies the original miniature portrait, which showed the sultan standing before a bookcase of some 200 volumes, by leaving him with a single book in his hand.

These sketches (1993.248.1619 and 1993.248.1617) suggest not only the artist’s keen powers of observation, but also provide a contrast to the romanticized works by Delacroix through the depiction of the animal’s sparse, apparently inhumane living quarters.

Eileen Hunter worked in a freelance capacity, and this bold and dramatic large-scale pattern, produced in a limited run, would have offered something new and exclusive for consumers.

Each of these three series illustrates different frameworks employed by the British graphic design firm A Practice for Everyday Life (APFEL). Identical elements such as the use of typeface, color, and layout combined with unique components such as photography or color to distinguish one edition from another are featured in each series. In the Exhibition Histories series, the approach by APFEL is straightforward, with a consistent layout and typeface; each edition is distinguished by a unique color for the text and spine. The Happy Hypocrite, also designed by APFEL, unifies the varied full-bleed graphics that wrap each cover with the same placement and typeface for the title of each book. However, the fifth edition diverges from this format—the title of the book is enlarged and wraps around to the back cover as part of the background image, yet still retains essential components of the framework to identify with the series. These designers use multiple approaches to insert distinguishing characteristics in order to develop unique editions within a unified series.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/216598/exhibition-histories-series-making-art-global-part-1-the-third-havana-biennial-1989

She is Lady Mary Duncan, who idolized the Italian mezzosoprano castrato Gaspare Pacchierotti (seen standing just behind the piano) to the point of extreme rudeness toward other musicians. The satirist Isaac Cruikshank would poke fun at her emotional attachment to the singer in another print a decade later.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/90018/a-sunday-concert

At least 170 women artists are known to have worked for the Underground, but the number is undoubtedly much higher because more than 1,200 posters are unattributed and many are signed only with initials.

Each of these three series illustrates different frameworks employed by the British graphic design firm A Practice for Everyday Life (APFEL). Identical elements such as the use of typeface, color, and layout combined with unique components such as photography or color to distinguish one edition from another are featured in each series. In the Exhibition Histories series, the approach by APFEL is straightforward, with a consistent layout and typeface; each edition is distinguished by a unique color for the text and spine. The Happy Hypocrite, also designed by APFEL, unifies the varied full-bleed graphics that wrap each cover with the same placement and typeface for the title of each book. However, the fifth edition diverges from this format—the title of the book is enlarged and wraps around to the back cover as part of the background image, yet still retains essential components of the framework to identify with the series. These designers use multiple approaches to insert distinguishing characteristics in order to develop unique editions within a unified series.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/216461/the-happy-hypocrite-what-am-i-issue-5

All, including this example, share a simple ribbed construction and are engraved with subjects such as the Crucifixion, the Trinity, or images of saints with their attributes. This example depicts the Virgin and Child flanked by Saints Margaret and Catherine. Such rings—traditionally called iconographic rings—were presented as gifts and bequests or included in a dowry settlement. Used as a private call to regular and intimate daily prayers, many examples are deeply worn. This suggests that the wearer rubbed the ring during devotions.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/203695/ring-with-the-virgin-and-child-and-saints-margaret-and-catherine

These included a lion displayed at the London Exeter Exchange menagerie, whose dissected body he may later have viewed in 1820. These sketches (1993.248.1619 and 1993.248.1617) suggest not only the artist’s keen powers of observation, but also provide a contrast to the romanticized works by Delacroix through the depiction of the animal’s sparse, apparently inhumane living quarters.

eng_4854,APFEL (Designer),Paper,"The Happy Hypocrite - Linguistic Hardcore, Issue 1","Cohesive layouts and modular frameworks provide the underpinning of an identity in a publication series. Each of these three series illustrates different frameworks employed by the British graphic design firm A Practice for Everyday Life (APFEL). Identical elements such as the use of typeface, color, and layout combined with unique components such as photography or color to distinguish one edition from another are featured in each series. In the Exhibition Histories series, the approach by APFEL is straightforward, with a consistent layout and typeface; each edition is distinguished by a unique color for the text and spine. The Happy Hypocrite, also designed by APFEL, unifies the varied full-bleed graphics that wrap each cover with the same placement and typeface for the title of each book. However, the fifth edition diverges from this format—the title of the book is enlarged and wraps around to the back cover as part of the background image, yet still retains essential components of the framework to identify with the series. These designers use multiple approaches to insert distinguishing characteristics in order to develop unique editions within a unified series.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/216453/the-happy-hypocrite-linguistic-hardcore-issue-1

The pattern exemplifies Brown’s work of the mid 1950s-1970s, which often incorporated optical illusions and employed mathematical references to produce a sense of motion and three-dimensionality. Brown’s bold and thoughtful design sensibility attracted the attention of Heal’s Fabrics, who purchased designs from Brown prior to her graduation from the Royal College of Art. Brown worked for Heal’s exclusively and the firm proclaimed her the “golden girl of Heal’s Fabrics” in a 1967 promotional brochure.

eng_5405,,"Lead glass, iron, and brass",Chandelier,"Made in England around 1760, this is a rare and relatively early example of a facet-cut lead-glass chandelier. Lead glass, also called lead “crystal,” had been developed in the late 1680s and was prized for its heft, brightness, and clarity—qualities that made it strikingly similar to precious rock crystal, or colorless diamonds. Of particular importance was the ability of lead glass to be cut without shattering. Cut decoration on English glass first appeared in the 1720s, and chandeliers made of facet-cut lead glass became fashionable around the middle of the eighteenth century. Glass chandeliers were not only among the most expensive furnishings of an elite interior—they were also quite expensive to light. The cost of candles for an evening could be equal to several weeks’ wages for a glassworker.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/266206/chandelier
eng_5406,Jacob Sang,Lead glass,Goblet with Cover,"This covered goblet would have been used to serve a beverage known as kandeel, a nourishing mix of eggs, liquor, and cinnamon, commonly served to women shortly after child birth. It is engraved with a design that reflects this, depicting a maternity chamber with a new mother in a canopied bed, a seated nurse rocking a baby in a cradle, a device for drying diapers, two chairs and a table set with two dishes of sweetmeats, and two goblets of the same shape as this one. Along the rim runs the toast T WELVAAREN VAN DE KRAAMVROUW EN KINDJE, which reads, “to the health of the woman in childbed and her baby.”The engraving is attributed to the Amsterdam glass engraver Jacob Sang (active 1752–62). There was an enormous demand in the Netherlands for personalized glassware, indispensable accessories used to commemorate a wide range of political, commercial, and personal occasions in Dutch drinking culture. Standard themes were commemorated by glasscutters of different skills, who often consulted the same design sources, with varying degrees of success, and applied their engravings to glass blanks of different qualities. Sang was one of Amsterdam’s most skillful and acclaimed engravers, and this covered goblet is a finely-blown vessel with perfectly-placed optic bubbles in the stem.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/266209/goblet-with-cover

Though he was a friend and business associate of William Morris—the leader of a movement advocating handcrafted rather than machine-made goods—Benson saw the possibilities of mass production and founded his own factory in 1880, equipped with the latest machines to streamline the manufacturing process. He created innovative designs for everything from chandeliers, electric lamps, and fireplace accessories to such newly invented modern conveniences as the electric kettle. Rather than relying on elaborate decoration for effect, Benson took advantage of the inherent reflective qualities of his materials. The polished metal surface of these wall sconces would have enhanced the light from the candles they held.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/221118/wall-sconce

For this series of posters for the Globe Theatre in London, GTF subverted standard representations of theater performance. Rather than capture performances on stage, for the 2003 and 2004 season, GTF asked photographer Nigel Shafran to capture images of actors backstage, putting on their costumes or resting in the Green Room. The photographs are unexpected and provide a rare glimpse of quiet moments behind the scenes. In 2005 the studio turned the lens to the audience, capturing the vivid expressions of theatergoers and prompting the viewer to imagine what is happening on stage.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/193492/shakespeare-s-globe-theater-poster

The Stag and Flower Pattern Frame has an eclectic combination of design elements, while the Lotus Pattern Frame incorporates Egyptian motifs.

At first Moore refused; however, soon after he himself had to hide in an underground subway tunnel during a German bombing raid, he accepted Clark’s offer. Moore’s first government assignment was to capture graphically the fear, pain, and anguish he witnessed in the tunnels, resulting in a powerful series of bomb-shelter drawings.By the end of summer 1941, Moore’s interest in producing shelter drawings had waned, and his friend Herbert Read, a philosopher and writer, suggested he depict coal miners who, because their work was crucial to the war effort, were called “Britain’s Underground Army.” The son of a miner, Moore felt an immediate connection to this new subject, and he returned to his hometown, Castleford, to begin the series. Years later he described the brutality of mining conditions: “If one were to describe what Hell might be like, this would do.” After completing one sketchbook in the mine, Moore returned to his studio, where he filled two additional notebooks with images of miners; the Art Institute’s drawings were removed from one such book.Moore’s concentration on miners allowed him to focus on two themes he had not yet explored : men and the figure in motion. Previously, he had depicted principally women and children and the figure at rest. This shift is illustrated in this sketch; constricted to narrow, low tunnels, ranged one above the other, miners walk, bend, and use picks and shovels. Though his figures are not static, Moore acknowledged that their actions were so constrained by the space so that they could use only the top half of their bodies: “the lower part is stuck [to the floor of the mine] as it were to the pedestal.”",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/151018/miners

His source was Samuel Butler’s satirical, mock-heroic poem written in the vein of Cervantes and Rabelais. Ridiculing the puritan party’s attempts to overthrow the British monarchy during the Great Civil War of 1640, Butler’s poem exposes the hypocrisy and pretensions of the Presbyterians, Independents, and Zealots who hoped to establish themselves as leaders.Hudibras’ grand departure into the world appears to be neither impressive, nor particularly noble, from the point of view of the frightened fruit seller at the lower right of this print. Accompanied, Don Quixote-like, by a single squire, the paunchy ruffian is hardly a grand knight sallying forth. He barely seems to be aware of where he is going, and appears unable to stay upright on his overtaxed horse.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/184607/hudibras-sallying-forth-plate-two-from-hudibras

He worked in reverse of the final printed images, which were produced by inking the plates and running them through a roller press with dampened sheets of paper on top. The small cross at the bottom of each plate was added when Hogarth issued the second state, released over a decade after the first, much copied edition.

He worked in reverse of the final printed images, which were produced by inking the plates and running them through a roller press with dampened sheets of paper on top. The small cross at the bottom of each plate was added when Hogarth issued the second state, released over a decade after the first, much copied edition. The prints on view nearby are early second state impressions, made before the addition of other changes and noticeable wear.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/132529/plate-four-from-a-harlot-s-progress

In The Pencil of Nature—one of the first commercially produced, photographically illustrated books—Talbot noted an advantage of the new art form beyond mere duplication: “it enables us at pleasure to alter the scale, and to make the copies as much larger or smaller than the originals as we may desire… . Yet preserving all the proportions of the original.” Here Talbot reduced an 1829 engraving by Luigi Rossini of a Roman arch to approximately 15 percent of its original size. Even on a smaller scale, Talbot’s image retains the delicate lines and detail of the engraving.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/127285/copy-of-a-large-italian-print-reduced-in-the-camera

Issued with verses from Samuel Butler’s poem as explanatory captions, Hudibras foreshadows the “moral progresses” for which Hogarth is perhaps best remembered. In this scene, Hudibras visits the woman he is wooing but is surprised by a group of masked attackers. Believing them to be spirits sent by the astrologer Sidrophel, Hudibras confesses his sins and, by extension, the sins of the Puritans as a whole.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/184614/hudibras-catechized-plate-nine-from-hudibras

He worked in reverse of the final printed images, which were produced by inking the plates and running them through a roller press with dampened sheets of paper on top. The small cross at the bottom of each plate was added when Hogarth issued the second state, released over a decade after the first, much copied edition. The prints on view nearby are early second state impressions, made before the addition of other changes and noticeable wear.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/132529/plate-four-from-a-harlot-s-progress

In The Pencil of Nature—one of the first commercially produced, photographically illustrated books—Talbot noted an advantage of the new art form beyond mere duplication: “it enables us at pleasure to alter the scale, and to make the copies as much larger or smaller than the originals as we may desire… . Yet preserving all the proportions of the original.” Here Talbot reduced an 1829 engraving by Luigi Rossini of a Roman arch to approximately 15 percent of its original size. Even on a smaller scale, Talbot’s image retains the delicate lines and detail of the engraving.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/127285/copy-of-a-large-italian-print-reduced-in-the-camera

Issued with verses from Samuel Butler’s poem as explanatory captions, Hudibras foreshadows the “moral progresses” for which Hogarth is perhaps best remembered. In this scene, Hudibras visits the woman he is wooing but is surprised by a group of masked attackers. Believing them to be spirits sent by the astrologer Sidrophel, Hudibras confesses his sins and, by extension, the sins of the Puritans as a whole.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/184614/hudibras-catechized-plate-nine-from-hudibras

In The Pencil of Nature—one of the first commercially produced, photographically illustrated books—Talbot noted an advantage of the new art form beyond mere duplication: “it enables us at pleasure to alter the scale, and to make the copies as much larger or smaller than the originals as we may desire… . Yet preserving all the proportions of the original.” Here Talbot reduced an 1829 engraving by Luigi Rossini of a Roman arch to approximately 15 percent of its original size. Even on a smaller scale, Talbot’s image retains the delicate lines and detail of the engraving.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/127285/copy-of-a-large-italian-print-reduced-in-the-camera

At the point in Hudibras that is depicted here, Samuel Butler digressed for a canto to lampoon Oliver Cromwell and discuss the infamous burning of the rumps, the celebratory burning of effigies of members of the Long Parliament of 1640–49. In The Committee, a meeting of the Puritan Saints is interrupted with news of the celebrations. Butler and Hogarth together made the political atmosphere of this scene both humorous and easy for the general public of the time to understand.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/184615/the-committee-plate-ten-from-hudibras

Fine woolen textiles were the backbone of the English economy for hundreds of years, from the late middle ages until well into the 19th century. Britain’s North American colonies provided a ready market for luxury goods like these patterned wool fabrics. In fact, a dress in the collection of Colonial Williamsburg is made of a very similar textile (inventory number 1988.223).",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/256793/two-joined-panels-of-brocaded-yellow-furnishing-wool

Decades of experimentation led to the development of a variety of ways to apply color and pattern to cloth, which enabled artists and designers to invent new design vocabularies and quickly respond to cultural trends and ideas. One of the most enduring of these innovations was the ability to print on cloth with copperplates and then subsequently with engraved copper metal rollers. The quality of detail achieved through this method was unrivaled in terms of clarity, precision.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/257368/curtain-fragment

Brown’s bold and thoughtful design sensibility attracted the attention of Heal’s Fabrics, who purchased designs from Brown prior to her graduation from the Royal College of Art. Brown worked for Heal’s exclusively and the firm proclaimed her the “golden girl of Heal’s Fabrics” in a 1967 promotional brochure.

eng_8505,APFEL (Designer),Paper,"The Happy Hypocrite - Linguistic Hardcore, Issue 1","Cohesive layouts and modular frameworks provide the underpinning of an identity in a publication series. Each of these three series illustrates different frameworks employed by the British graphic design firm A Practice for Everyday Life (APFEL). Identical elements such as the use of typeface, color, and layout combined with unique components such as photography or color to distinguish one edition from another are featured in each series. In the Exhibition Histories series, the approach by APFEL is straightforward, with a consistent layout and typeface; each edition is distinguished by a unique color for the text and spine. The Happy Hypocrite, also designed by APFEL, unifies the varied full-bleed graphics that wrap each cover with the same placement and typeface for the title of each book. However, the fifth edition diverges from this format—the title of the book is enlarged and wraps around to the back cover as part of the background image, yet still retains essential components of the framework to identify with the series. These designers use multiple approaches to insert distinguishing characteristics in order to develop unique editions within a unified series.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/216453/the-happy-hypocrite-linguistic-hardcore-issue-1

A destination far from the center of London meant a longer ride, and a longer ride meant a higher fare and more revenue.Reginald Gossop excelled at creating imaginative maps that focused on London’s theater district, shopping destinations for the winter sales, or, as in this case, the city’s array of tourist attractions. He is best known as an agent for other artists but created a number of important designs himself, including the logo for the famous booksellers W. H.

Yet preserving all the proportions of the original.” Here Talbot reduced an 1829 engraving by Luigi Rossini of a Roman arch to approximately 15 percent of its original size. Even on a smaller scale, Talbot’s image retains the delicate lines and detail of the engraving.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/127285/copy-of-a-large-italian-print-reduced-in-the-camera

The two multi-figured scenes depict some form of ritual or sacrifice, the nature of which has not been convincingly identified. The large female figure on the left is a motif George Romney used numerous times in his society portraits, in which his subject is posed outdoors leaning on a plinth in classical dress.The vibrancy, immediacy, and rapid-fire execution of the drawing suggest that it was made after Romney’s two-year stay in Italy (1773–75).",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/112196/figure-studies

At the point in Hudibras that is depicted here, Samuel Butler digressed for a canto to lampoon Oliver Cromwell and discuss the infamous burning of the rumps, the celebratory burning of effigies of members of the Long Parliament of 1640–49. In The Committee, a meeting of the Puritan Saints is interrupted with news of the celebrations. Butler and Hogarth together made the political atmosphere of this scene both humorous and easy for the general public of the time to understand.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/184615/the-committee-plate-ten-from-hudibras

eng_9370,William Henry Fox Talbot,Salted paper print,Copy of the Title Page for “Inclytae Regiae Societati Londinensi”,"A gentleman-scholar with an intense interest in science, William Henry Fox Talbot was one of the inventors of photography. His negative-positive process—using paper negatives to create potentially limitless prints—enabled the duplication and dissemination of images with relative ease. Among the many consequences of this new technology, it revolutionized the reproduction of art, as paintings, lithographs, and etchings could be made in reduced or enlarged sizes. For Talbot photography was intimately related to mass production, and in 1844 he set up the Reading Establishment, which printed his calotypes and published the world’s first commercial photographically illustrated book, The Pencil of Nature. This image, depicting the title page of a Royal Society of London publication featuring an address by Isaac Newton, reveals both Talbot’s reverence for this august scientific group and his interest in photography as an improvement on the traditions of print reproduction.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/127287/copy-of-the-title-page-for-inclytae-regiae-societati-londinensi

Around 1890 James McNeill Whistler encouraged Roussel to take up the technique, and the younger artist created a small number of transfer lithographs with the assistance of Whistler’s printers, Thomas and Thomas Robert Way. The Ways also provided the specially prepared paper.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/211089/standing-figure-in-a-chinese-gown

Roussel developed his plate through multiple states, used a variety of ink colors, and employed selective wiping to suggest differing effects of light, water, and mist.
