ch_1,,Qingbai ware; porcelain with underglaze molded and carved decoration,Incense Burner in the Form of a Duck,"In its subtle elegance, this incense burner reflects the refined sensibility of Song dynasty China’s cultural elite—members of the imperial court as well as newly affluent and well-educated classes of merchants and government officials. The basin of this incense burner, elevated on a lobed foot, contains an artichokelike lotus that opens into two tiers of small, pointed petals and supports a delicately carved waterfowl. Fragrant smoke would have wafted gently from the bird’s mouth and from two holes perforated between its feet. As Song poets and painters praised incense for its efficacy in dissipating gloom and stimulating artistic creativity, connoisseurs treasured its accoutrements as luxurious domestic furnishings. Pieces displaying the extraordinary quality of this incense burner are attributed to the kilns at Jingdezhen in southeastern Jiangxi province, which later became China’s preeminent center for ceramic production.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/43060/incense-burner-in-the-form-of-a-duck
ch_2,,Bronze,Cauldron,"As this monumental cauldron demonstrates, the most distinctive bronze vessels of early China represent important historical documents as well as stunningly powerful works of art. Designed to contain offerings of meat in ritual ceremonies, this vessel was cast with a lengthy inscription on its interior bowl. The text commemorates a solemn ritual ceremony at the imperial court of the Zhou, the second dynasty recorded in Chinese texts, and explains that Captain Wang, a noble official who had been rewarded for his loyal service to the Zhou king, commissioned this vessel to honor his deceased father and record the occasion for succeeding generations. Together with the inscription, the vessel’s shallow profile and austere surface decor date it to the early ninth century BC. Although the monsterlike masks that project from each leg display animal imagery common on older bronzes, the two registers of hooked, ribbonlike bands that encircle the bowl preserve only traces of early dragon or bird patterns. The transition from zoomorphic to abstract surface designs marks a significant turning point in the art of early Chinese bronzes. Recent archaeological discoveries of similar bronze vessels in China indicate that this cauldron was most likely buried as part of a large hoard.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/185963/cauldron
ch_3,,Earthenware with polychrome pigments,Equestrienne,"Chinese ceramic figures made exclusively for burial often vividly evoke the fashions and recreational activities of their aristocratic owners. This figure sensitively captures a quiet moment in the life of a matronly equestrienne, who gently guides her horse. The animal’s powerful neck and flanks, long legs, trimmed mane, and decoratively tied tail are features distinctive to the handsome breeds that were brought to China from the empire’s northwestern frontiers as well as from sites as far west as the Aral Sea. Carefully twisted strands of clay realistically depict the fur-like texture of the animal’s saddle blanket. The woman’s full proportions—evident in the folds of her flowing, wide-sleeved robe, as well as in her plump cheeks and double chin—are enhanced by her loosely gathered coiffure, which is topped with a dangling forehead bun. Her weight, costume, and hairstyle reflect early-to-mid-eighth-century ideals of feminine beauty. Stylistically, the woman closely resembles figures that archeologists have recently unearthed from the tombs of high-status individuals that are datable to about 740.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/35376/equestrienne
ch_4,,Handscroll; ink and light color on paper,Yang Pu Moving His Family,"With a lively combination of realism and caricature, this detail of the painting Yang Pu Moving His Family depicts a group of peasants transporting a rustic scholar and his family across a stream. Distinguished by his official government cap, with its long streamers, the otherwise disheveled, bare-legged scholar bids farewell to his neighbors on the shore. Servants valiantly attempt to carry children and the family’s belongings—scrolls, furniture, and dishes—through the water. The scholar depicted here may represent Yang Pu, a character described in stories of the Southern Song dynasty (1127–1279). According to folklore, Yang Pu initially declined, and then reluctantly accepted, his appointment to a government position in the capital city. Chinese law forbade civil officials from working in their native districts, and as a result, many were required to relocate to distant cities. Painters and poets frequently depicted the theme of farewell, or “noble parting,” exemplified by the story of Yang Pu. The twigs that protrude from the official caps of the men depicted here may allude to the ancient Chinese custom of presenting departing friends with small branches from a willow tree.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/76279/yang-pu-moving-his-family
ch_5,,Stoneware with olive-green glaze and molded and applied decoration,Funerary Urn (Hunping),"This complex and imaginatively modeled vessel is known as an “urn of the soul,” a symbolic dwelling for the spirit of the deceased. A profusion of figures was molded and applied to its sealed lid, which takes the form of a multistory pavilion. In the balcony-like mouth-rim, a tortoise supports a large vertical tablet, a common form of memorial stone. The real and mythical creatures on the vessel—birds, monkeys, bears, dragons, kneeling figures, and immortals riding dragons—all follow the iconography of early Chinese funerary art. Intermingled with these images, however, are depictions of the Buddha, who is identified by his meditating posture, topknot, and halo. The marginal role of Buddhist art in this decorative scheme reflects the adoption of the alien Indian religion, as the Chinese then understood it, into a hospitable mélange of different spiritual beliefs. Additionally, this jar reflects a formative stage in the development of China’s renowned celadon glaze, which became more uniform in color and texture over subsequent centuries.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/70003/funerary-urn-hunping
ch_6,,Hollow dry lacquer,Head of a Luohan,"In traditional Buddhist belief, the luohan is a disciple who has attained enlightenment through intense personal effort. Beginning in the ninth century, the worship of luohan and their depiction in art evolved primarily in the context of the Chan (Zen), or “meditation,” sect of Buddhism. This head was created in the delicate technique of hollow dry lacquer. The artisan first soaked layers of coarse cloth in lacquer (a thick sap tapped from a sumac tree) and applied these to a clay core formed over an armature of wood or other material. After allowing the work to dry, he applied a thick layer of lacquer paste to create the basic shape of the sculpture and a thinner coat into which he carefully modeled the eyes, high cheekbones, and other facial features. After removing the core and supporting armature, he set colored beads behind the eyes to represent irises and pupils. Finally, he painted the surface and perhaps applied gilding. Although these surface finishes have disintegrated over the centuries, the sensitively executed facial features preserve the insightful expression of the luohan.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/88724/head-of-a-luohan
ch_7,,"Silk, weft-float faced 1:2 'S' twill weave of complementary wefts and inner warps (samite)",Fragment (Dress Fabric),"This textile reflects the cosmopolitan richness and inventiveness of the Tang dynasty. During this period, caravans of merchants and Buddhist clerics traversed the vast network that modern scholars call the Silk Road, transporting China’s luxurious silks westward across Asia and returning with exotic goods from empires extending to the Mediterranean Sea.In this textile’s jewel-like floral medallion, symmetrically curled and layered tendrils derived from the classical half palmette were adopted and refined by Chinese weavers from foreign sources. The stylized floral head seen from above, the blossoming stems in three-quarter view, and the half palmettes in profile merge naturalism and geometry by subtly varying perspective and color. This design pervaded East Asian decorative arts; similar floral medallions and scrolls embellish wall paintings, stone carvings, and vessels of ceramic and silver that Tang aristocrats commissioned for their tombs, Buddhist temples, and private treasuries. Architectural tiles from palace sites in Korea and, most notably, exquisite silk fabrics and carpets preserved in the Shosoin repository in Nara, Japan, attest to the transmission of these patterns throughout East Asia in the eighth century.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/149681/fragment-dress-fabric
ch_8,Yao Shou,Handscroll; ink and color on paper,Pillars of the Country,"Together with those of a riverscape, rocks, flowers, and branches of cedar and bamboo, the magpie is one of six images painted by Yao Shou along the length of this handscroll. Its portrayal represents a venerable genre of painting known as “bird-and-flower,” whose finest artists had achieved extraordinary refinement and realism by the eleventh century. Yao Shou’s vision, however, was far more personal if seemingly simpler. He described the magpie almost solely in varied tonalities of black ink; the branches are accented with darker twigs and dotted leaves but possess little sense of spatiality; and the bamboo leaves are rendered in freely executed strokes of pale blue.Yao Shou accompanied the magpie—as he did its companion images—with an original poem written in his characteristically elegant cursive script and signed with his courtesy name, Gongshou:In the bright moonlight, why does themagpie circle three times beforealighting?During sunny days, it sings on the greenbranches.I also practice divination to find the placewhere the magpie often roosts.It stays on the rooftop of the old master’shouse, and the stars arrive late.The title and artist’s biography combine to add poignancy to this work. “Pillars of the Country” refers to the vital role of intellectuals in supporting China’s integrity. Almost thirty years earlier, gratuitous slander had driven Yao Shou from a prestigious career in government service to retirement as a painter, calligrapher, collector, and scholar —  all pursuits of a traditional literatus. Now advanced in years, he expressed his cultivated ideals in both the willful spontaneity of his brushwork and the informed allusions in his inscription, adapting each line from that of a celebrated poem from centuries past.As documented by several seals impressed on its surface, this painting once held an honored place in the collection of the Qianlong emperor (r. 1736–95), China’s most passionate imperial collector.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/79507/pillars-of-the-country
ch_9,,Chlorite,Kneeling Figure,"This starkly poignant figure, probably a male, kneels with his hands bound behind him with two rounds of thick rope. Parted down the middle, his hair resembles an open book; finely incised parallel lines suggest that it has been meticulously combed, and a long double braid hangs down his back. His facial features are defined by raised eyebrows, high cheekbones, a tight mouth that curves slightly downward, and large pierced ears that project perpendicularly from his head. Evoking fierceness and shock, the man stares blankly ahead—like a subdued victim anticipating a terrifying, painful punishment. Figures with proportions and features similar to this sculpture have recently been unearthed at sites in southwestern Sichuan Province that date to the second millennium BC. Whereas those images were carved from more roughly textured stones and sometimes preserve traces of pigment, this example’s smooth, blackish-green surface appears unique. Scientific analyses indicate that the sculpture was probably darkened by burning before burial and, upon rediscovery, was polished and saturated with wax.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/70207/kneeling-figure
ch_10,Huang Binhong,Album leaves; ink and color on paper,Landscapes,"Two figures sitting quietly in their lakeside villa draw us into their vibrantly painted environment—undulating hills of cursory, fragmented outline and blurry wash; bent and twisted trees of densely layered brushstrokes; and mist, water, and sky of blank paper. Executed with different angles of the paintbrush and multiple layers and varied densities of ink, paintings of such careful synthesis and sketch-like spontaneity describe what the artist Huang Binhong called “the order of disorder.”Huang, who is recognized as one of China’s greatest twentieth-century masters, helped reinvigorate that country’s tradition of literati painting. He disdained stereotypical themes and styles that had become increasingly prevalent since the eighteenth century and looked to earlier artists for inspiration. Indeed, the inscription on this painting alludes to brushstrokes of “broken ink” demonstrated by eminent masters of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.Its limited use of color and caricature-like simplicity suggest that this painting dates to the late 1940s or early 1950s. By then, Huang had reached the pinnacle of his painting career and simultaneously distinguished himself as a connoisseur, scholar, poet, and publisher. Exceptional in his passion for and knowledge of both Western and Chinese art, he corresponded with Western intellectuals who appreciated his insights on the principles as well as practice of Chinese painting. They included Lucy Catherine Driscoll, a lecturer in art history and aesthetics at the University of Chicago, who had begun her career at the Art Institute as an educator and administrator.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/34299/landscapes
ch_11,,Porcelain painted in underglaze blue and overglaze enamels (doucai),Pair of Cups,"The emperors of China’s last dynasty, the Qing, were enamored of exquisitely decorative objects and recruited remarkable craftsmen to serve their court. During his brief reign, the Yongzheng emperor, himself an artist and astute connoisseur, took a personal role in overseeing the imperial kilns. In their elegance and technical sophistication, these extraordinarily thin cups exemplify his exacting standards. Their floral medallions were delicately outlined in pale cobalt blue and, after glazing and firing, filled with soft, translucent enamels. So perfectly do these enamels fill the outlines that this technique is known as doucai (joined or dovetailed colors). Although quite different from the naturalistic floral motifs that characterize many Qing imperial porcelains, these medallions are also seen in rare examples of exquisite Yongzheng ware in the Palace Museum in Beijing. Their style may reflect the influence of Japanese lacquers, which were imported into China in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and subsequently inspired creative copies by Chinese palace craftsmen. The Yongzheng emperor was renowned for having encouraged innovative and sometimes foreign-inspired design in ceramics as well as other decorative arts.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/42566/pair-of-cups

ch_15,,Limestone with traces of polychromy,Buddha,"Following its introduction from India centuries earlier, Buddhism flourished in China under the powerfully cosmopolitan Tang dynasty. Characteristic of Tang style in its robust, tapered physique, this monumental figure exhibits iconographic features distinctive to the Buddha: tightly curled hair covering a cranial mound symbolizes his enlightenment; and a forehead depression that originally held a stone or jewel represents wisdom. The articulated folds of the deity’s flowing robe integrate Indian sensuality with a distinctly Tang blend of realism and linear elegance. Capping the deity’s right shoulder, this garment discreetly modifies a fully bare-chested style described in Indian monastic texts.The stepped pedestal rises from a base encircled by lotus petals pure white flowers that rise from muddy water and thereby evoke Buddhist beliefs in purity and the search for enlightenment. Above, musicians encircling the tapered stem evoke an ideal, celestial realm.Together with two attendant bodhisattvas in the Art Institute collection (1930.84 and 1930.85), this sculpture came to the museum in 1930 with a note of its discovery in a temple known as Cangfosi in northern Hebei province. Neither archaeological nor written records have been located to confirm this reported site. The scale and stone medium of these figures suggest that they were commissioned for a cave temple or shrine—a chamber carved into the face of a mountain or cliff.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/86380/buddha

ch_22,,Limestone with traces of polychromy,Bodhisattva,"In eighth-century China, Buddhist sculptors adopted new standards of secular beauty for spiritual figures. Whereas images of the Buddha appear sternly formal, bodhisattvas, the merciful deities that guide men toward salvation, often display more humanistic features. This bodhisattva’s graceful proportions, upswept hair, sinuous drapery, and delicate jewelry convey an appealing physical elegance. Seated informally, the deity is poised to step down from its pedestal.Together with a large seated Buddha and another attendant bodhisattva in the Art Institute collection (1930.83, 1930.84), this sculpture came to the museum in 1930 with a note of its discovery in a temple known as Cangfosi in northern Hebei province. Neither archaeological nor written records have been located to confirm this reported site.

ch_23,,Stone,Buddhist Votive Stele,"Buddhist stone tablets known as votive steles were commissioned by pious individuals and families, and erected in temple courtyards and other public spaces. The horizontal registers on this stele illustrate scenes from the life of the Buddha and from sacred texts. The upper pair of niches on this side depicts the death of the Buddha (right) and preparations for his cremation (left). On the opposite side, the primary scene represents the Buddha preaching the Lotus Sutra, a major scripture transmitted from India. The niches above show the Buddha flanked by monks and bodhisattvas (enlightened beings). Surrounding carvings portray ascetics, guardians, protective lions, heavenly musicians, and priests. Inscribed around the lower portion are the names of donors who commissioned this stele to commemorate their ancestors. The most important of these donors appear as standardized figures with parasols held aloft by their attendants. By commissioning such tablets, pious devotees hoped to gain spiritual benefits for themselves and their families.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/29149/buddhist-votive-stele

ch_27,,Jian ware; dark-gray stoneware with dark-brown glaze and overglaze “hare’s fur” markings in iron oxide,Tea Bowl,"Song dynasty potters achieved unprecedented refinement in iron-rich, chocolate brown stonewares with lustrous dark glazes. This bowl’s “hare’s fur” effect was formed naturally when an iron-rich slip was applied to the rim of the glazed surface. During firing, gravity pulled particles of this slip downward into the bowl, creating feathery streaks.The much-admired style of this piece originated at kilns in southeastern Fujian province, which specialized almost exclusively in conical tea bowls. These bowls fit perfectly in cupped hands and visually intensified the milky froth of white tea, brewed from young tea leaves that were steamed, baked, press-molded into cakes, reground to a fine powder, and then blended and whipped with boiling water. This type of blackware is popularly designated temmoku, the Japanese name of a mountain in south China and the site of a Buddhist monastery where Japanese monks treasured such bowls for tea-drinking rituals.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/20392/tea-bowl

From then on, many Chinese rulers and members of elite society, of both native and foreign heritage, became fervent devotees of Tibetan Buddhism. This faith is also known as Vajrayana (Diamond Path) Buddhism or, for its esoteric teachings derived largely from Hinduism, Tantric Buddhism. Buddhist images made in China but influenced by Tibetan (as well as Nepalese) iconography and style are termed Sino-Tibetan.This image depicts one of many emanations of the compassionate god Tara. An inscription on the top surface of its throne reads “Da Ming Yongle nian zhi” (Bestowed in the Yongle reign of the Great Ming).
