ch_1,,Qingbai ware; porcelain with underglaze molded and carved decoration,Incense Burner in the Form of a Duck,"In its subtle elegance, this incense burner reflects the refined sensibility of Song dynasty China’s cultural elite—members of the imperial court as well as newly affluent and well-educated classes of merchants and government officials. The basin of this incense burner, elevated on a lobed foot, contains an artichokelike lotus that opens into two tiers of small, pointed petals and supports a delicately carved waterfowl. Fragrant smoke would have wafted gently from the bird’s mouth and from two holes perforated between its feet. As Song poets and painters praised incense for its efficacy in dissipating gloom and stimulating artistic creativity, connoisseurs treasured its accoutrements as luxurious domestic furnishings. Pieces displaying the extraordinary quality of this incense burner are attributed to the kilns at Jingdezhen in southeastern Jiangxi province, which later became China’s preeminent center for ceramic production.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/43060/incense-burner-in-the-form-of-a-duck
ch_2,,Bronze,Cauldron,"As this monumental cauldron demonstrates, the most distinctive bronze vessels of early China represent important historical documents as well as stunningly powerful works of art. Designed to contain offerings of meat in ritual ceremonies, this vessel was cast with a lengthy inscription on its interior bowl. The text commemorates a solemn ritual ceremony at the imperial court of the Zhou, the second dynasty recorded in Chinese texts, and explains that Captain Wang, a noble official who had been rewarded for his loyal service to the Zhou king, commissioned this vessel to honor his deceased father and record the occasion for succeeding generations. Together with the inscription, the vessel’s shallow profile and austere surface decor date it to the early ninth century BC. Although the monsterlike masks that project from each leg display animal imagery common on older bronzes, the two registers of hooked, ribbonlike bands that encircle the bowl preserve only traces of early dragon or bird patterns. The transition from zoomorphic to abstract surface designs marks a significant turning point in the art of early Chinese bronzes. Recent archaeological discoveries of similar bronze vessels in China indicate that this cauldron was most likely buried as part of a large hoard.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/185963/cauldron
ch_3,,Earthenware with polychrome pigments,Equestrienne,"Chinese ceramic figures made exclusively for burial often vividly evoke the fashions and recreational activities of their aristocratic owners. This figure sensitively captures a quiet moment in the life of a matronly equestrienne, who gently guides her horse. The animal’s powerful neck and flanks, long legs, trimmed mane, and decoratively tied tail are features distinctive to the handsome breeds that were brought to China from the empire’s northwestern frontiers as well as from sites as far west as the Aral Sea. Carefully twisted strands of clay realistically depict the fur-like texture of the animal’s saddle blanket. The woman’s full proportions—evident in the folds of her flowing, wide-sleeved robe, as well as in her plump cheeks and double chin—are enhanced by her loosely gathered coiffure, which is topped with a dangling forehead bun. Her weight, costume, and hairstyle reflect early-to-mid-eighth-century ideals of feminine beauty. Stylistically, the woman closely resembles figures that archeologists have recently unearthed from the tombs of high-status individuals that are datable to about 740.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/35376/equestrienne
ch_4,,Handscroll; ink and light color on paper,Yang Pu Moving His Family,"With a lively combination of realism and caricature, this detail of the painting Yang Pu Moving His Family depicts a group of peasants transporting a rustic scholar and his family across a stream. Distinguished by his official government cap, with its long streamers, the otherwise disheveled, bare-legged scholar bids farewell to his neighbors on the shore. Servants valiantly attempt to carry children and the family’s belongings—scrolls, furniture, and dishes—through the water. The scholar depicted here may represent Yang Pu, a character described in stories of the Southern Song dynasty (1127–1279). According to folklore, Yang Pu initially declined, and then reluctantly accepted, his appointment to a government position in the capital city. Chinese law forbade civil officials from working in their native districts, and as a result, many were required to relocate to distant cities. Painters and poets frequently depicted the theme of farewell, or “noble parting,” exemplified by the story of Yang Pu. The twigs that protrude from the official caps of the men depicted here may allude to the ancient Chinese custom of presenting departing friends with small branches from a willow tree.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/76279/yang-pu-moving-his-family
ch_5,,Stoneware with olive-green glaze and molded and applied decoration,Funerary Urn (Hunping),"This complex and imaginatively modeled vessel is known as an “urn of the soul,” a symbolic dwelling for the spirit of the deceased. A profusion of figures was molded and applied to its sealed lid, which takes the form of a multistory pavilion. In the balcony-like mouth-rim, a tortoise supports a large vertical tablet, a common form of memorial stone. The real and mythical creatures on the vessel—birds, monkeys, bears, dragons, kneeling figures, and immortals riding dragons—all follow the iconography of early Chinese funerary art. Intermingled with these images, however, are depictions of the Buddha, who is identified by his meditating posture, topknot, and halo. The marginal role of Buddhist art in this decorative scheme reflects the adoption of the alien Indian religion, as the Chinese then understood it, into a hospitable mélange of different spiritual beliefs. Additionally, this jar reflects a formative stage in the development of China’s renowned celadon glaze, which became more uniform in color and texture over subsequent centuries.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/70003/funerary-urn-hunping
ch_6,,Hollow dry lacquer,Head of a Luohan,"In traditional Buddhist belief, the luohan is a disciple who has attained enlightenment through intense personal effort. Beginning in the ninth century, the worship of luohan and their depiction in art evolved primarily in the context of the Chan (Zen), or “meditation,” sect of Buddhism. This head was created in the delicate technique of hollow dry lacquer. The artisan first soaked layers of coarse cloth in lacquer (a thick sap tapped from a sumac tree) and applied these to a clay core formed over an armature of wood or other material. After allowing the work to dry, he applied a thick layer of lacquer paste to create the basic shape of the sculpture and a thinner coat into which he carefully modeled the eyes, high cheekbones, and other facial features. After removing the core and supporting armature, he set colored beads behind the eyes to represent irises and pupils. Finally, he painted the surface and perhaps applied gilding. Although these surface finishes have disintegrated over the centuries, the sensitively executed facial features preserve the insightful expression of the luohan.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/88724/head-of-a-luohan
ch_7,,"Silk, weft-float faced 1:2 'S' twill weave of complementary wefts and inner warps (samite)",Fragment (Dress Fabric),"This textile reflects the cosmopolitan richness and inventiveness of the Tang dynasty. During this period, caravans of merchants and Buddhist clerics traversed the vast network that modern scholars call the Silk Road, transporting China’s luxurious silks westward across Asia and returning with exotic goods from empires extending to the Mediterranean Sea.In this textile’s jewel-like floral medallion, symmetrically curled and layered tendrils derived from the classical half palmette were adopted and refined by Chinese weavers from foreign sources. The stylized floral head seen from above, the blossoming stems in three-quarter view, and the half palmettes in profile merge naturalism and geometry by subtly varying perspective and color. This design pervaded East Asian decorative arts; similar floral medallions and scrolls embellish wall paintings, stone carvings, and vessels of ceramic and silver that Tang aristocrats commissioned for their tombs, Buddhist temples, and private treasuries. Architectural tiles from palace sites in Korea and, most notably, exquisite silk fabrics and carpets preserved in the Shosoin repository in Nara, Japan, attest to the transmission of these patterns throughout East Asia in the eighth century.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/149681/fragment-dress-fabric
ch_8,Yao Shou,Handscroll; ink and color on paper,Pillars of the Country,"Together with those of a riverscape, rocks, flowers, and branches of cedar and bamboo, the magpie is one of six images painted by Yao Shou along the length of this handscroll. Its portrayal represents a venerable genre of painting known as “bird-and-flower,” whose finest artists had achieved extraordinary refinement and realism by the eleventh century. Yao Shou’s vision, however, was far more personal if seemingly simpler. He described the magpie almost solely in varied tonalities of black ink; the branches are accented with darker twigs and dotted leaves but possess little sense of spatiality; and the bamboo leaves are rendered in freely executed strokes of pale blue.Yao Shou accompanied the magpie—as he did its companion images—with an original poem written in his characteristically elegant cursive script and signed with his courtesy name, Gongshou:In the bright moonlight, why does themagpie circle three times beforealighting?During sunny days, it sings on the greenbranches.I also practice divination to find the placewhere the magpie often roosts.It stays on the rooftop of the old master’shouse, and the stars arrive late.The title and artist’s biography combine to add poignancy to this work. “Pillars of the Country” refers to the vital role of intellectuals in supporting China’s integrity. Almost thirty years earlier, gratuitous slander had driven Yao Shou from a prestigious career in government service to retirement as a painter, calligrapher, collector, and scholar —  all pursuits of a traditional literatus. Now advanced in years, he expressed his cultivated ideals in both the willful spontaneity of his brushwork and the informed allusions in his inscription, adapting each line from that of a celebrated poem from centuries past.As documented by several seals impressed on its surface, this painting once held an honored place in the collection of the Qianlong emperor (r. 1736–95), China’s most passionate imperial collector.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/79507/pillars-of-the-country
ch_9,,Chlorite,Kneeling Figure,"This starkly poignant figure, probably a male, kneels with his hands bound behind him with two rounds of thick rope. Parted down the middle, his hair resembles an open book; finely incised parallel lines suggest that it has been meticulously combed, and a long double braid hangs down his back. His facial features are defined by raised eyebrows, high cheekbones, a tight mouth that curves slightly downward, and large pierced ears that project perpendicularly from his head. Evoking fierceness and shock, the man stares blankly ahead—like a subdued victim anticipating a terrifying, painful punishment. Figures with proportions and features similar to this sculpture have recently been unearthed at sites in southwestern Sichuan Province that date to the second millennium BC. Whereas those images were carved from more roughly textured stones and sometimes preserve traces of pigment, this example’s smooth, blackish-green surface appears unique. Scientific analyses indicate that the sculpture was probably darkened by burning before burial and, upon rediscovery, was polished and saturated with wax.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/70207/kneeling-figure
ch_10,Huang Binhong,Album leaves; ink and color on paper,Landscapes,"Two figures sitting quietly in their lakeside villa draw us into their vibrantly painted environment—undulating hills of cursory, fragmented outline and blurry wash; bent and twisted trees of densely layered brushstrokes; and mist, water, and sky of blank paper. Executed with different angles of the paintbrush and multiple layers and varied densities of ink, paintings of such careful synthesis and sketch-like spontaneity describe what the artist Huang Binhong called “the order of disorder.”Huang, who is recognized as one of China’s greatest twentieth-century masters, helped reinvigorate that country’s tradition of literati painting. He disdained stereotypical themes and styles that had become increasingly prevalent since the eighteenth century and looked to earlier artists for inspiration. Indeed, the inscription on this painting alludes to brushstrokes of “broken ink” demonstrated by eminent masters of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.Its limited use of color and caricature-like simplicity suggest that this painting dates to the late 1940s or early 1950s. By then, Huang had reached the pinnacle of his painting career and simultaneously distinguished himself as a connoisseur, scholar, poet, and publisher. Exceptional in his passion for and knowledge of both Western and Chinese art, he corresponded with Western intellectuals who appreciated his insights on the principles as well as practice of Chinese painting. They included Lucy Catherine Driscoll, a lecturer in art history and aesthetics at the University of Chicago, who had begun her career at the Art Institute as an educator and administrator.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/34299/landscapes
ch_11,,Porcelain painted in underglaze blue and overglaze enamels (doucai),Pair of Cups,"The emperors of China’s last dynasty, the Qing, were enamored of exquisitely decorative objects and recruited remarkable craftsmen to serve their court. During his brief reign, the Yongzheng emperor, himself an artist and astute connoisseur, took a personal role in overseeing the imperial kilns. In their elegance and technical sophistication, these extraordinarily thin cups exemplify his exacting standards. Their floral medallions were delicately outlined in pale cobalt blue and, after glazing and firing, filled with soft, translucent enamels. So perfectly do these enamels fill the outlines that this technique is known as doucai (joined or dovetailed colors). Although quite different from the naturalistic floral motifs that characterize many Qing imperial porcelains, these medallions are also seen in rare examples of exquisite Yongzheng ware in the Palace Museum in Beijing. Their style may reflect the influence of Japanese lacquers, which were imported into China in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and subsequently inspired creative copies by Chinese palace craftsmen. The Yongzheng emperor was renowned for having encouraged innovative and sometimes foreign-inspired design in ceramics as well as other decorative arts.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/42566/pair-of-cups

ch_15,,Limestone with traces of polychromy,Buddha,"Following its introduction from India centuries earlier, Buddhism flourished in China under the powerfully cosmopolitan Tang dynasty. Characteristic of Tang style in its robust, tapered physique, this monumental figure exhibits iconographic features distinctive to the Buddha: tightly curled hair covering a cranial mound symbolizes his enlightenment; and a forehead depression that originally held a stone or jewel represents wisdom. The articulated folds of the deity’s flowing robe integrate Indian sensuality with a distinctly Tang blend of realism and linear elegance. Capping the deity’s right shoulder, this garment discreetly modifies a fully bare-chested style described in Indian monastic texts.The stepped pedestal rises from a base encircled by lotus petals pure white flowers that rise from muddy water and thereby evoke Buddhist beliefs in purity and the search for enlightenment. Above, musicians encircling the tapered stem evoke an ideal, celestial realm.Together with two attendant bodhisattvas in the Art Institute collection (1930.84 and 1930.85), this sculpture came to the museum in 1930 with a note of its discovery in a temple known as Cangfosi in northern Hebei province. Neither archaeological nor written records have been located to confirm this reported site.

ch_22,,Limestone with traces of polychromy,Bodhisattva,"In eighth-century China, Buddhist sculptors adopted new standards of secular beauty for spiritual figures. Whereas images of the Buddha appear sternly formal, bodhisattvas, the merciful deities that guide men toward salvation, often display more humanistic features. This bodhisattva’s graceful proportions, upswept hair, sinuous drapery, and delicate jewelry convey an appealing physical elegance. Seated informally, the deity is poised to step down from its pedestal.Together with a large seated Buddha and another attendant bodhisattva in the Art Institute collection (1930.83, 1930.84), this sculpture came to the museum in 1930 with a note of its discovery in a temple known as Cangfosi in northern Hebei province.

ch_23,,Stone,Buddhist Votive Stele,"Buddhist stone tablets known as votive steles were commissioned by pious individuals and families, and erected in temple courtyards and other public spaces. The horizontal registers on this stele illustrate scenes from the life of the Buddha and from sacred texts. The upper pair of niches on this side depicts the death of the Buddha (right) and preparations for his cremation (left). On the opposite side, the primary scene represents the Buddha preaching the Lotus Sutra, a major scripture transmitted from India. The niches above show the Buddha flanked by monks and bodhisattvas (enlightened beings). Surrounding carvings portray ascetics, guardians, protective lions, heavenly musicians, and priests. Inscribed around the lower portion are the names of donors who commissioned this stele to commemorate their ancestors. The most important of these donors appear as standardized figures with parasols held aloft by their attendants.

ch_27,,Jian ware; dark-gray stoneware with dark-brown glaze and overglaze “hare’s fur” markings in iron oxide,Tea Bowl,"Song dynasty potters achieved unprecedented refinement in iron-rich, chocolate brown stonewares with lustrous dark glazes. This bowl’s “hare’s fur” effect was formed naturally when an iron-rich slip was applied to the rim of the glazed surface. During firing, gravity pulled particles of this slip downward into the bowl, creating feathery streaks.The much-admired style of this piece originated at kilns in southeastern Fujian province, which specialized almost exclusively in conical tea bowls. These bowls fit perfectly in cupped hands and visually intensified the milky froth of white tea, brewed from young tea leaves that were steamed, baked, press-molded into cakes, reground to a fine powder, and then blended and whipped with boiling water. This type of blackware is popularly designated temmoku, the Japanese name of a mountain in south China and the site of a Buddhist monastery where Japanese monks treasured such bowls for tea-drinking rituals.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/20392/tea-bowl

From then on, many Chinese rulers and members of elite society, of both native and foreign heritage, became fervent devotees of Tibetan Buddhism. This faith is also known as Vajrayana (Diamond Path) Buddhism or, for its esoteric teachings derived largely from Hinduism, Tantric Buddhism. Buddhist images made in China but influenced by Tibetan (as well as Nepalese) iconography and style are termed Sino-Tibetan.This image depicts one of many emanations of the compassionate god Tara.

Xia Chang executed this painting with great breadth and boldness as a gift for a friend who had planted a bamboo grove around his retirement villa.As it bends without breaking, bamboo evoked human values of resiliency and endurance for intellectual painters of premodern China. Xia’s dedicatory inscription on this scroll, describing the bamboo garden as “washing away ordinary thought,” expresses their desire for retreat from the trials of official life. He had served the government in roles of calligrapher, draftsman, and administrative secretary before retiring for a decade in 1439, initially to care for his aged mother.

ch_43,,Buff earthenware with polychromy and gilding,Armored Guardian,"Ceramic figures made for burial in the tombs of princes and officials vividly evoke aspects of the elite life of China’s expansive and multicultural Tang dynasty (618-907). This armored guardian of haughty, impenetrable expression stands on a rocky plinth and was probably stationed close to the burial chamber to repel potential evil. One hand turns down in a clenched fist and the other turns upward with an outstretched finger, suggesting that both hands once brandished a weapon, now lost. His multilayered parade armor combines a helmet with upturned earflaps; neck and shoulder guards; scalloped breast and backplates secured by knotted ropes over a tunic with pleated hem; flared elbow cuffs over long, tight sleeves; and protective leggings under a sweeping skirt. The elements of this elaborate uniform were meticulously modeled in clay before firing and richly embellished with colors and gold pigment afterward.Because these so-called “cold pigments” are more vulnerable to deterioration than fired glazes, only traces of the most detailed patterns survive. These combine curled tendrils and scalloped floral scrolls on the armor, giving elegantly decorative flourishes to the armor of this impassive figure.Unlike most Tang figures that were formed in molds, this guardian appears to have been primarily hand-modeled, probably from coils of clay. It has survived remarkably intact; examination by museum conservators revealed only minimal restoration.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/48991/armored-guardian

ch_47,,Gray earthenware with impressed and carved decoration,Pair of Tomb Chamber Doors,"In northern China during the Han dynasty, hollow clay bricks were used to construct the small, rectangular chambers of underground tombs. The doors, pillars, and lintel assembled here reconstruct the entrance to such a chamber. Before firing, the bricks were stamped with vigorous images from daily life and from mythology. This combination of subject matters reflects a dualistic view of the human soul: separating at death, one part of the soul was thought to remain in the earthly tomb, while the other ascended to a paradise—the realm of ancestral spirits and of the special beings who have achieved immortality.Guardian images, both realistic and symbolic, are centered on each door. Two long-robed men (identified by inscription as tingzhang, village officials) flank another protective symbol, a ring-snouted monster mask. Surrounding this central square are border strips depicting scenes of entertainment and of animals, hunters, and chariots charging across mountains. Winged xian—immortal, elf-like figures—are also depicted in a mountainous setting. Other emblematic designs that appear repeatedly on these doors include a spade-shaped evergreen tree, designating family continuity and longevity, and a disk enclosing a bird in flight, which can be identified with the sun.On the lintel above, soldiers bearing shields flank a protective monster mask. On either side of this mask, jade disks tied by cords may symbolize prosperity or other auspicious wishes for the soul.

From right to left, the scroll depicts a fisherman’s accidental discovery of a peaceful and bountiful farming valley, which is isolated within a mountain cave. The valley’s inhabitants, who had fled from political turmoil six centuries earlier, are unaware of subsequent events in the outside world. Blossoming peach trees, symbolic of immortality, conceal the entrance to their secluded paradise.In depicting this mythic tale, many artists utilized a traditional palette of finely ground mineral pigments-azurite blue and malachite green- to evoke this jewel-like land. Qiu Ying was a renowned master of this “blue-and-green technique. While consistent with Qiu Ying’s precise and decorative style, the soft and restrained brushwork of this scroll suggests that it was painted by one of his close followers.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/75361/the-peach-blossom-spring-%E6%A1%83%E8%8A%B1%E6%BA%90%E5%9C%96

The Chinese reserved this imagery for Maitreya (Chinese: Mi-le), the Buddha of the Future, who waits in a cosmic heaven before descending to earth. This figure of Maitreya is about to step off his throne into this world, fulfilling the hopes and prayers of the faithful. His right hand is raised in a mudra (gesture) meaning “fear not.” Flames, emphasizing radiance and holy presence, border his outer halo, and his head is framed by an open lotus, whose blossoms also rise beneath his feet. Because it emerges pure white from muddy water, the lotus is a pervasive symbol of the Buddhist nature within all living things.An inscription on the base of this image states that it was dedicated in 705 by the Buddhist disciple Yang Zongchun “for the sake of [his] deceased parents and seven generations of deceased ancestors, present family members, and all paternal and maternal relatives.” The inscription also mentions that the figure was part of a triad, originally flanked by two bodhisattvas representing emanations of Mi-le’s power and mercy, respectively.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/11690/maitreya-buddha-mi-le-%E5%BD%8C%E5%8B%92%E4%BD%9B

ch_66,,Bronze,Wine Container,"The bronze vessels produced with sophisticated casting techniques and intricate designs by Chinese artisans of the late Shang dynasty (c. 1700-c. 1050 B.C.) are achievements unrivaled by any other Bronze Age culture. For the ruling elite of ancient China, prestigious objects made of bronze signified supreme political power as well as devout spiritual beliefs and exalted social status. Foremost among these bronzes are vessels that were made for the preparation and offering of food, wine, and water in ceremonial banquets conducted to seek and repay divine ancestral goodwill. Ancient Chinese wine was fermented from grain rather than fruit and, like beer, is best described as a type of millet ale.This square-shouldered jar for wine storage is animated by a menagerie of imaginary creatures that have been intricately cast onto the surface in several levels of relief. The most prominent of these is a horned ogre mask (later known as a taotie), whose significance remains one of the great enigmas of early Chinese art. Here the taotie, inverted across the roof-like lid, recurs along the body within pendant triangular blades, each of which also contains a wide-eyed cicada at its tip. The cicada is found often on Chinese bronzes, perhaps because its extraordinarily long life cycle carried associations of regeneration. Confronted pairs of jaunty, stylized birds encircle the neck of the vessel, with similarly disposed dragons—each with down-curved head plume and up-curved tail around the widest part of the body. Birds and dragons are separated by a shoulder band of whorl circles, nose-diving dragons, and four fully sculpted bovine heads, two purely decorative and two surmounting lug handles. Two more such handles were cast on below to facilitate lifting. Compact, sharply cast spirals covering both the relief-cast taotie, dragons, and birds, and their receding background impart a shimmering effect to the surface, now covered with thin layers of cuprite red, malachite green, and azurite blue patina.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/26647/wine-container

ch_69,,Marble with traces of metal fittings at crown,Head of Guanyin,"The benign, altruistic aspect of Buddhism is expressed in this beautifully sculpted marble head of the bodhisattva Guanyin (Sanskrit: Avalokitesvara). The miniature image of the Buddha known as Amitabha (Amituo), depicted in the crown, is clear indication of the bodhisattva’s identity. Certain features of this head are shared with other Buddhist icons: the concave forehead circle (urna) is an auspicious mark from which wisdom radiates; the elongated earlobes allude to the aristocratic Indian custom of wearing heavy earrings, and thereby to the Buddha’s early life as an Indian prince.This majestic head, which was severed from a monumental standing figure, characterizes the finest sculpture made in far northern China in the late sixth century. The fine-grain white marble from this area was well suited to rounded, smoothly polished surfaces and austere, idealized images. Serene benevolence emanates from Guanyin’s gentle, meditative expression (somewhat altered by later recutting of the pupils of the eyes).",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/9613/head-of-guanyin

Each mask is composed of prominent horns, eyes, nose, upper jaw, and ears. The low ridge or flange, which bisects each mask, marks a division in the clay mold assembly used to cast this vessel. This type of three-legged cauldron is the most common of all ritual vessels; even after the end of China’s Bronze Age, it remained a symbol of the political authority and legitimacy of the ruling house. Cast on the inside wall is the family emblem: Bing.Originally golden in color, this vessel developed a surface corrosion or patina during centuries of burial underground. It was subsequently cleaned, recoated, and darkened probably by heating. The resulting smooth, blackish brown surface is characteristic of many bronzes that have come down to us from collections of the 19th century and earlier.

ch_83,,Gray earthenware with impressed and carved decoration,Pillar from Tomb Chamber,"In northern China during the Han dynasty, hollow clay bricks were used to construct the small, rectangular chambers of underground tombs. The doors, pillars, and lintel assembled here reconstruct the entrance to such a chamber. Before firing, the bricks were stamped with vigorous images from daily life and from mythology. This combination of subject matters reflects a dualistic view of the human soul: separating at death, one part of the soul was thought to remain in the earthly tomb, while the other ascended to a paradise—the realm of ancestral spirits and of the special beings who have achieved immortality.Guardian images, both realistic and symbolic, are centered on each door. Two long-robed men (identified by inscription as tingzhang, village officials) flank another protective symbol, a ring-snouted monster mask. Surrounding this central square are border strips depicting scenes of entertainment and of animals, hunters, and chariots charging across mountains. Winged xian—immortal, elf-like figures—are also depicted in a mountainous setting. Other emblematic designs that appear repeatedly on these doors include a spade-shaped evergreen tree, designating family continuity and longevity, and a disk enclosing a bird in flight, which can be identified with the sun.On the lintel above, soldiers bearing shields flank a protective monster mask. On either side of this mask, jade disks tied by cords may symbolize prosperity or other auspicious wishes for the soul.

The Indonesian form is combined with Chinese decorative motifs like flowering plum branches and fruit clusters.This kendi was then shipped to the Near East, possibly to Persia (modern day Iran), where such vessels were often adapted for use as water pipes. By the early 1600s, it had made its way to England, most likely imported by one of the East India trading companies. Additions to the piece testify to the artistry of English silversmiths: an eagle-headed spout was added to the bulbous mouth of the porcelain jug and connected by a set of hinged straps to the waist and base of the vessel. A scroll handle links the waist to the lidded cover.

ch_94,Zhu Yu,Handscroll; ink and colors on paper,Street Scenes in Times of Peace 太平風會圖,"This impressive handscroll depicts more than four hundred figures that together represent a broad variety of professional occupations, social types, public interactions and expressive poses. The scroll is a rare example of genre painting, seemingly newly emerged during the Song dynasty (960-1279), that took the public activities of common people as its subject-matter. The title, added in the frontispiece to the painting, literally reads “Collection of Customs during Times of Peace” (Taiping fenghui), referring to the totality of social and professional activities of a given community. The absence of an articulated background to the depiction of these activities, and their general composition around typological groups, is a feature shared with the medium of the model-book. Such painting manuals provided a collection of iconographic cartouches for copying into larger, integrated compositions. However, the particular compositional features of this scroll, including complex interaction among groups of figures, overall spatial coherence, and the nature of activities portrayed (including transportation, performance, and public sales), interestingly suggest that its horizontal pictorial surface stands here for the public space of the ‘street’. Activities portrayed include the transportation of goods, livestock, and people, commercial activities, including divinatory and clerical services, public entertainment, and even the accidental entertainment provided by a runaway donkey causing a stir. The social array of characters runs the gamut from street-beggar to scholarly recluse (with staff and servant carrying a lute), from men to women and children. Some of the hats and clothing of these figures appear to be Mongol in type, which lends additional interest to the temporal context of production of this particular painting: if painted in the Ming, the reference to the Mongol presence during the preceding Yuan dynasty adds a retrospective, historicizing note to this portrayal of public life.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/76275/street-scenes-in-times-of-peace-%E5%A4%AA%E5%B9%B3%E9%A2%A8%E6%9C%83%E5%9C%96

He shared the tea ceremony with a Buddhist monk, while another servant draws fresh water from a nearby stream.Five years after Wu Kuan’s death, Tang Yin executed this delicate vignette in the writer’s memory.

The audience for this concert strikingly resembles court figures depicted in The Night Revels of Han Xizai, a painting in the Palace Museum, Beijing, attributed to the tenth century painter Gu Hongzhong.

ch_137,,Limestone,Section of a Buddhist Pagoda,"These two stone slabs originally formed the first story of a miniature Buddhist pagoda, which was elevated on a tiered base. Many such pagodas, usually standing seven or nine stories tall, are preserved from the eighth century in northern China.Now separated for display, these slabs were once tightly aligned to form one chamber whose interior was visible only though a canopied doorway cut into the front slab. Dynamic guardians, flying apsaras (heavenly beings), writhing dragons, and an ogre mask protect this doorway, which opens into a sacred space. The Buddha, seated in the center, is flanked by two bodhisattvas (compassionate saintly beings) holding lotus flowers. The bodhisattvas’ fluid postures, which echo those of sensual images from contemporary Indian art, distinguish many Buddhist sculptures of early-eighth-century China.A long inscription, carved into the left side of both slabs, states that the family of Jia Heida commissioned this pagoda in honorable devotion to his deceased parents. Replete with Buddhist metaphors and allusions to the Buddha s life, this text opens with a bleak perspective on the physical world and then praises both Buddhist teachings of spiritual redemption and secular values of Chinese filial devotion. The inscription closes with a prayer extolling Buddhist principles.The back of the rear slab is incised with images of two brothers, the bodhisattvas of medicine, who vow to heal the sick. The elder brother (left) holds a bowl containing a lotus flower, which symbolizes medicine; the younger brother (right) joins his hands in prayer. A small figure in the lower-left corner, who reaches out with one arm, as if pleading for medicine, may represent a faithful devotee. Inscriptions along the far-left and far-right edges identify the patron of these images as Konghui, a Buddhist nun.

ch_140,,Limestone,Panels from a Funerary Couch (Guanchuang),"These stone panels were originally assembled to enclose the back and short sides of a low, couchlike platform that held a coffin in a tomb. This “funerary couch” was probably supported along the front and back by two long stone slabs, each elevated on rectangular feet. Such a coffin platform may also have been partially enclosed in front by two stones carved to resemble gate towers, making the couch resemble the walled enclosure of a villa or a city.The original order of the Art Institute stones is not certain. Their present sequence is based on their relative lengths and pictorial compositions as well as on the alignment of the iron hinges. The left and right stones—one including a bullock cart, the other a horse with decorative trappings—may each have formed one short side of the funerary couch. The two stones between them—depicting scenes of figures under canopied platforms or umbrellas (both symbols of high status)—together may have formed the back of this structure. As reconstructed, these scenes present a symmetrical composition that is bracketed at either end by figures facing inward. Such linear drawings in stone enable us to imagine the appearance of early horizontal scroll paintings.Eight framed figural compositions are engraved into the inner surface of these smoothly polished stones. The figures’ proportions and clothing are characteristic of early sixth-century Chinese styles, as known from datable tomb figurines, stone carvings, and rare surviving paintings. Except for the bearded gentlemen and those wearing baggy trousers and small “official” caps, with or without projecting wings, most of these figures seem to depict women. Not all figures, however, can be clearly distinguished as to sex, since long robes with wide collars, high sashes, and flowing sleeves were worn by aristocratic men and women alike, who also shared a hairstyle of upswept side buns. These figures are grouped in stagelike settings—hills, mountains, trees and bushes with decorative foliage patterns, and windblown cloudbands—which suggest what early pictorial landscapes may have looked like.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/142531/panels-from-a-funerary-couch-guanchuang

ch_144,,Jade,Dragon Pendant,"These matching pendants were designed as serpentine dragons with backturned heads, coiled tails, and small fins that project above and below their undulating trunks. The rhythmic fluency of these creatures belies the unyielding quality of jade—a compact, fine-grained stone that cannot be carved and must be worn away with abrasive paste applied to its surface with saws, grinders, and drills. The craftsman’s remarkable dexterity with this intractable material is displayed in smoothly rounded, heart-shaped units and delicately incised spirals, striations, and cross-hatching that thoroughly enliven both the front and back surfaces. Their substantial size and thickness, technical refinement, and glossy polish point to aristocratic patronage. That these pendants were likely designed to drape down the owner’s shoulders or from a waistband is indicated by holes pierced for suspension through the creatures’ hindquarters. Toward the end of the Bronze Age when these pendants were created, sinuously curved dragons had become prominent motifs in many luxurious materials. Contemporary literature suggests that such dynamic creatures were not merely decorative but also envisioned as supernatural beings. When buried with the deceased, jade pendants like these may have reflected widely held beliefs in the dragon as a vehicle that could transport the human soul on its journey to the netherworld.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/70115/dragon-pendant

Some of the disciples pictured flaunt pseudo-religious “miracles”: one opens his stomach to reveal the Buddha nature within and another magically creates a temple in mid-air. Other disciples nonchalantly engage on superficially mundane activities that allude to Buddhist conduct, such as mending clothes and reading sutras.

Chinese porcelains decorated with such images reflected prevailing European fashion for masquerades and were generally commissioned for export to France, Italy, and Holland. As characteristic of many export wares ordered and shipped abroad by maritime companies and private traders, the panels of Chinese landscape encircling this French image create a truly multicultural composition.Although this dish was most likely intended for a French or other European client, the introduction of European aristocratic culture to China may also have piqued the interest of wealthy Chinese consumers in such romantically exotic designs.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/42879/dish-with-europeans-playing-musical-instruments

Previously unknown in China, such delicately colored mineral pigments were partly inspired by the art of painted enamel on copper that was introduced to the Chinese court by northern European Jesuit missionaries in the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries. Masterfully created and applied by potters and painters at the imperial workshops, these subtle tones were termed “powdered colors”, “soft colors,” and “foreign colors.” by their court patrons.These graceful branches of fruiting peaches and plum blossoms, juxtaposed with five red bats (two of which are under the rim), carry subtly auspicious messages.

Two layers of petals, beaten in repousse, enclose birds, floral sprays, and clusters of grapes—all delicately chased and gilded against a ringmatted ground.

ch_183,Ren Yi,Hanging scroll; ink and colors on paper,The Five Virtues,"Ren Yi was among the most successful and influential among Chinese painters of the so-called Shanghai School. Arriving in Shanghai in 1857, he took the artistic name “bonian” (one-hundred years), claiming that it would take him a century to achieve success. However, by 1875 Ren Yi was the best-known painter in Shanghai. His highly sought-after bird-and-flower paintings initially followed the Song dynasty (960–1279) convention of applying rich color fields within outlines, producing decorative patterning with lifelike representation. This work represents his mature, more spontaneous style that is characterized by looser brushwork, more ink washes, and greater tonal variation.These five pairs of birds represent the Five Cardinal Relationships, following the Neo-Confucian principle that strict and proper implementation of hierarchy among different groups achieves social harmony. Above, a pair of long-tailed phoenixes roosting in the branches of a Wutong tree represents the preeminent relationship: a ruler and his subjects. Emerging from behind are two cranes, who, more commonly associated with longevity, represent filial piety. Perched above the cranes, a pair of orioles signifies the relationship between older and younger siblings. Marital loyalty is embodied in the pair of ducks swimming in the water below, and friendship is captured in the jovial interaction of two wagtails. The artist’s choice of such an orthodox subject revealed his firm belief in the traditional values of Chinese society.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/46423/the-five-virtues

ch_198,Ren Yi,Hanging scroll; ink and colors on paper,Mandarin Ducks and Lotus,"Ren Yi was among the most successful and influential among Chinese painters of the so-called Shanghai School. Arriving in Shanghai in 1857, he took the artistic name “bonian” (one-hundred years), claiming that it would take him a century to achieve success. However, by 1875 Ren Yi was the best-known painter in Shanghai. His highly sought-after bird-and-flower paintings initially followed the Song dynasty (960–1279) convention of applying rich color fields within outlines, producing decorative patterning with lifelike representation. This painting represents his mature, more spontaneous style that is characterized by looser brushwork, more ink washes, and greater tonal variation.Although his inscription states that Ren Yi executed this work in the winter “with a frozen ink stone,” he clearly depicted an early summer scene. Four large lotus leaves, brushed with wet-ink washes, overpower a pair of young, delicate blossoms. The aquatic lotus emerges with pristine beauty from murky water and thereby carries enduring associations with Buddhist beliefs in purity and rebirth. Above the lotus, partially camouflaged by wind-swept reeds, swims a pair of mandarin ducks—traditional symbols of marital bliss and fidelity. Painted with sharp, quick brush strokes, this engaging depiction of the young couple suggests an intimacy appropriate for lifelong partners.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/46435/mandarin-ducks-and-lotus

This cache is said to have comprised more than one hundred twenty vessels.Identical inscriptions cast inside the basin and lid inform us that this vessel was commissioned by Ke, who served as a quartermaster (shenfu) at the Zhou court. The text states that the Ke had this vessel made to commemorate the occasion when the king registered Ke s fields and men, and that he used it to make offerings to his ancestors. It also tells us that the vessel was to be passed on to Ke’s descendants, who were to eternally treasure and use it:“It was the eighteenth year, twelfth month, first auspiciousness, gengyin (day 27); the king was in the Kang Mu Palace at Zhou. The king commanded the chief attendant’s assistant Secretary Xin to record Quartermaster Ke’s fields and men. Ke bowed and touched his head to the ground, daring in response to extol the Son of Heaven’s illustriously gracious beneficence, herewith making this sacrificial xu vessel. It is to be used to contribute to the wedding of the captain-in-chief’s friends. May Ke herewith morning and night make offering to his august grandfather, and may his august grandfather and deceased-father cascadingly send down on Ke many blessings, long life, and an eternal mandate to serve the Son of Heaven. May Ke be daily awarded beneficence without limit, and may Ke for ten thousand years have sons’ sons and grandsons’ grandsons eternally to treasure and use it.” (Translated Edward L.

ch_226,,Earthenware with brown lead glaze,Curly-Haired Youth,"Tang artisans delighted in observing and depicting traders and travelers from around the world who flocked to China’s major cities. Wearing a toga-like robe and knee-length pantaloons, the figurine of a dark-skinned, curly-haired young boy evokes Tang descriptions of people from “Kunlun,” – a term derived from the remote and mysterious Kunlun Mountains mentioned in ancient mythology. However, it had come to refer to people of non-Chinese origin – especially those from the southern maritime countries in Asia – during the Tang Dynasty.Clay figures similar to this one were interred in Tang tombs to serve the deceased. With raised hands and a tilted body, the figure exudes a strong sense of movement. It likely portrays a rowing scene: the small holes on the hands might have been used to attach a wooden paddle. Enslaved people of Kunlun (kunlun nu) played a significant role in various maritime operations.

ch_228,,Limestone,Panels from a Funerary Couch (Guanchuang),"These stone panels were originally assembled to enclose the back and short sides of a low, couchlike platform that held a coffin in a tomb. This “funerary couch” was probably supported along the front and back by two long stone slabs, each elevated on rectangular feet. Such a coffin platform may also have been partially enclosed in front by two stones carved to resemble gate towers, making the couch resemble the walled enclosure of a villa or a city.The original order of the Art Institute stones is not certain. Their present sequence is based on their relative lengths and pictorial compositions as well as on the alignment of the iron hinges. The left and right stones—one including a bullock cart, the other a horse with decorative trappings—may each have formed one short side of the funerary couch. The two stones between them—depicting scenes of figures under canopied platforms or umbrellas (both symbols of high status)—together may have formed the back of this structure. As reconstructed, these scenes present a symmetrical composition that is bracketed at either end by figures facing inward. Such linear drawings in stone enable us to imagine the appearance of early horizontal scroll paintings.Eight framed figural compositions are engraved into the inner surface of these smoothly polished stones. The figures’ proportions and clothing are characteristic of early sixth-century Chinese styles, as known from datable tomb figurines, stone carvings, and rare surviving paintings. Except for the bearded gentlemen and those wearing baggy trousers and small “official” caps, with or without projecting wings, most of these figures seem to depict women. Not all figures, however, can be clearly distinguished as to sex, since long robes with wide collars, high sashes, and flowing sleeves were worn by aristocratic men and women alike, who also shared a hairstyle of upswept side buns. These figures are grouped in stagelike settings—hills, mountains, trees and bushes with decorative foliage patterns, and windblown cloudbands—which suggest what early pictorial landscapes may have looked like.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/142528/panels-from-a-funerary-couch-guanchuang
ch_229,"Longyu, Empress Dowager of China",Hanging scroll; ink and colors on silk,Tree Peonies in Full Bloom,"This boldly decorative painting is a significant document of Chinese-American relations. On February 17, 1913, the Empress Dowager Longyu (1868-1913) requested that it be delivered to the carriage of Mr. and Mrs. William C. Calhoun as they departed the imperial palace in Beijing. Mr. Calhoun, a Chicago attorney, had served as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary (American Ambassador) to China since 1909 and witnessed the fall of the Qing dynasty to a provisional republican government, ending China’s 2000 year-old imperial system. Prince Puyi (1906-67) had ruled for three years as the Xuantong emperor, under control of his father, Prince Pu Lun, and his foster mother, Longyu. Exactly one year before the Calhouns’ farewell —on February 17, 1912—his parents authorized the young boy to abdicate his throne.The inscription to the left of the peonies and the calligraphy on the mounting above are both signed by Lu Runxiang (1841-1915), a brilliant Chinese scholar. The large seal above the flowers belongs to Longyu; the brief inscription to the right of this seal, dated 1911, describes this painting as a work of the “imperial brush.” Yet the painter of these flowers remains unknown. In 1911, Emperor Xuantong would have been five or six years old, making his authorship highly unlikely.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/25247/tree-peonies-in-full-bloom

Each building was associated with a particular country, and they doubled as counting houses and living quarters, where agents resided during the fall trading season. In this view of the hongs, the American factory lies between those of the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, suggesting that this was an early rendering, made before the United States permanently established its factory next to Sweden’s.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/117475/punch-bowl
ch_237,Wang Meng,Hanging scroll; ink and light colors on paper,Quiet Life in a Wooded Glen 林麓幽居圖,"This modest cottage nestled at the foot of towering mountains presents a quintessential image of academic retreat from the “dusty” world of material concerns and political instabilities. Its cultured occupant kneels on a platform and plays the zither (qin); a book lies open before him and young servants wait attentively nearby. The luxuriant setting of layered peaks and intertwined trees, as well as the dry, charcoal- like treatment of fibrous and dotted boulders, is imbued with a textural richness. This style is closely associated with Wang Meng, the last of the “Four Great Masters” of the Yuan dynasty.Such a complex, kinetic composition reflects this artist’s distinctive contribution to the literati’s new use of painting as a vehicle for intellectual and emotional self-expression. This concept was largely kindled by social and political upheavals that accompanied the 14th-century Mongol conquest of China and the establishment of the Yuan dynasty. Wang Meng, who had served the Mongol government as a legal scribe, retired to a mountain hermitage in the turbulent final decades of Yuan rule.

Each bell was designed to emit two distinct tones: one from striking the center of the lower panel, another from striking either corner.

Since that time, printmakers in East Asia have refined the technique by experimenting with color, size, and ways of bringing the ink and paper into contact with the block.Today, Chinese artists employ this time-honored medium to depict everything from landscapes to abstract forms. They also use different types of pigments to create varying degrees of opacity. This work comes from a portfolio that was commissioned in 1999 by the Muban Foundation in London to recognize the achievements of Chinese printmakers.

ch_243,,Bronze,Food container,"The handled tureen is one of an extensive array of bronze vessels commissioned by China’s royal family and political aristocracy for the preparation and offering of millet and other food in ceremonial banquets. This vessel’s distinctive style, with its basin cast onto a hollow square base derived from an altar or stand, was introduced soon after the Zhou conquest of China’s first archaeologically verified dynasty, the Shang. Exuberantly imaginative creatures animate the surface. Two large, coiled dragons spread across each side of the bowl; animal-headed birds form the handles; and on the base, creatures with spiky, flame-like plumage display a clever ambiguity: they may be read as addorsed birds or as elephant-headed “dragons” facing each other.Inside the bottom of the basin, an inscription of eleven characters is countersunk in the metal and runs from top to bottom in two columns reading right to left: Zhong Cheng zuo you bao yi yong xiang wang ni wei yong [“Zhong Cheng makes his treasured vessel, to use to feast the king’s reciprocal immortalizing.” (translation by Edward L. Shaughnessy)]. This brief text commemorates a celebratory event: the commission of this vessel to entertain the king by a court official or attendant named Zhong Cheng.

ch_260,,Bronze,Goblet,"For nobility of the Shang dynasty, divine goodwill was enlisted and repaid with ritual offerings of food and drink. This vessel, which would have been placed over fire to heat sacrificial wine, displays the taut profile and precise surface decoration and distinguishes the finest bronzes commissioned for this purpose. Its surface decoration is intricately executed in several levels of relief. Two tiers of monster masks, each formed of hooks and spirals around a pair of staring eyes, encircle the flared bowl. Elongated versions of these masks, which may be read as paired serpents, descend the legs, while a snub-nosed bovine head with sculpted horns crowns the strap-handle. This intriguing imagery, set off a background of fine, squared spirals, reappears in endless variations on Shang bronzes, but eludes modern interpretation.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/109230/goblet

The depiction of figures gazing out from two water pavilions at the foot of a rocky outcrop—as well as a dramatic clusters of old pine-trees and billowing, restless forms of mountain-ridges that rise from valleys into the high distance—are all features associated with Guo Xi’s iconic landscapes. The relatively looser composition and hybrid brushwork, however, point to a Yuan re-interpretation of this Northern Song style.

Since the dragon was endowed with the same dynamic energy that animated clouds and vapors, it was graphically combined with expanding and contracting patterns of great imagination and vitality. Here, dragons with interlaced trunks merge with scrolling “cloud” patterns to create continuous bands of ornament. This fluent decor was incised into the bronze after casting. Filings of gold and silver were then liquefied in separate baths of hot mercury and these butter-like solutions brushed onto the bronze; the vessel was reheated to vaporize the mercury and then burnished, leaving a thin but brilliant two-toned surface. This technique, variously known as amalgam-, mercury-, or fire-gilding, created a splendid object with economic expenditure of precious metals.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/34075/jar-hu-or-zhong

As the fifth-century text New Account of Tales of the World (Shishuo xinyu) describes, Wang awoke in the midst of a snowy night and, inspired by a glass of wine, recalled the poem “Summons to a Retired Gentleman.” He then impulsively set out in a small boat to visit his reclusive friend Dai Kui. Upon arriving at Dai’s gate, however, Wang left without entering. Asked to explain his irrational behavior, he replied, “I originally went on the strength of an impulse, and when the impulse was spent, I turned back” (translated by Richard Mather). Wang appears here huddled in his boat, which is paddled by an attendant clothed in a straw raincoat.One or more large-scale compositions like this were typically commissioned for display in the grand reception halls of wealthy merchants and government officials. Encumbered by their urban lifestyles, these men typically idealized bucolic and often eccentric characters like the recluse portrayed here.

Most show tightly interlaced surface patterns like those cast in this piece.

For this painting, Wang Wen wrote a poem (also entitled “Song of a Fisherman”), which includes several allusions to moral integrity. This poem displays the artist’s distinctively fluid, cursive “draft script” (cao shu). Its first section reads as follows:Most men of the world fish with crooked hooks: I alone trust in hooks, but never in fancy baits. After rain, I carry my long pole to the terrace edge and dangle if from among pines and clouds above the ripples of Qi. (translated by Irving Yucheng Lo)Qi refers to a river in north-central China. This river is cited in several verses of the Shijing (Book of Odes) – a compilation of more than three hundred poems datable between about 1000 and 600 B.C that extol men of principle.

Arriving in Shanghai in 1857, he took the artistic name “bonian” (one-hundred years), claiming that it would take him a century to achieve success. However, by 1875 Ren Yi was the best-known painter in Shanghai. His highly sought-after bird-and-flower paintings initially followed the Song dynasty (960–1279) convention of applying rich color fields within outlines, producing decorative patterning with lifelike representation. This work represents his mature, more spontaneous style that is characterized by looser brushwork, more ink washes, and greater tonal variation.Six pairs of sparrows are perched among the branches of a weathered plum tree that is partially obscured by a large, moss-covered boulder. Since the delicate, five-petal plum blossom appears at the earliest sign of spring, often when the ground is still covered with snow, it is interpreted both as a harbinger of spring and as a symbol for endurance and virtue in the face of adversity. Here, Ren Yi captured the frenetic energy of the sparrows, also a sign of spring, by depicting each one in a unique pose.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/46466/birds-on-red-plum

Artists of the late Western Han dynasty (1st century B.C.) had pioneered this technology by coating vessels, figures, and other objects of porous red earthenware with striking but easily weathered glazes of copper green and iron amber-brown. Utilizing harder and lighter-toned clays (often brightened with white slip), carefully fritted (melted and crushed) glazes, and measured recipes of metallic oxides, the Tang created stable and brilliant hues. Generally termed “three-color” (sancai) after the archetypical combination of bright green, amber, and white (transparent) glazes, this palette also included a rare cobalt blue probably imported from Persia. Such fluid glazes could be dripped, spotted, splashed or neatly contained within carved, molded or impressed outlines.This footed dish was crisply impressed with a central, lotus-like medallion and surrounding cloud-like scrolls. Within those sharply grooved outlines, the craftsman carefully painted the amber, green, and blue glazes.

ch_385,,Limestone,Panels from a Funerary Couch (Guanchuang),"These stone panels were originally assembled to enclose the back and short sides of a low, couchlike platform that held a coffin in a tomb. This “funerary couch” was probably supported along the front and back by two long stone slabs, each elevated on rectangular feet. Such a coffin platform may also have been partially enclosed in front by two stones carved to resemble gate towers, making the couch resemble the walled enclosure of a villa or a city.The original order of the Art Institute stones is not certain. Their present sequence is based on their relative lengths and pictorial compositions as well as on the alignment of the iron hinges. The left and right stones—one including a bullock cart, the other a horse with decorative trappings—may each have formed one short side of the funerary couch. The two stones between them—depicting scenes of figures under canopied platforms or umbrellas (both symbols of high status)—together may have formed the back of this structure. As reconstructed, these scenes present a symmetrical composition that is bracketed at either end by figures facing inward. Such linear drawings in stone enable us to imagine the appearance of early horizontal scroll paintings.Eight framed figural compositions are engraved into the inner surface of these smoothly polished stones. The figures’ proportions and clothing are characteristic of early sixth-century Chinese styles, as known from datable tomb figurines, stone carvings, and rare surviving paintings. Except for the bearded gentlemen and those wearing baggy trousers and small “official” caps, with or without projecting wings, most of these figures seem to depict women. Not all figures, however, can be clearly distinguished as to sex, since long robes with wide collars, high sashes, and flowing sleeves were worn by aristocratic men and women alike, who also shared a hairstyle of upswept side buns. These figures are grouped in stagelike settings—hills, mountains, trees and bushes with decorative foliage patterns, and windblown cloudbands—which suggest what early pictorial landscapes may have looked like.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/142529/panels-from-a-funerary-couch-guanchuang

It also combines standard motifs of the landscape and flower-and-bird genres. Scattered across the foreground are mandarin ducks, lotus, and bamboo, a traditional grouping drawn from flower-and-bird painting of the Song dynasty. But the trees growing from the right side of the same area are treated in a contemporary, early fourteenth century manner. These trees lead the eye upward into the middle distance, where geese taking flight over rushes signify autumn, a seasonal reference confirmed by the bare treetops. The touches of color used to highlight various forms in the foreground, and the blue-green coloring applied to some of the rocks, are both archaizing features that emulate painting of the Tang dynasty (618-907). In the background are monumental mountain forms, convincingly portrayed as if shrouded in mist, derived from the Song landscape tradition.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/79716/flight-of-geese

These hard, reusable”pattern blocks,” were used as die-stamps to impress patterns in clay piece-mold assemblies and thereby facilitated the mass production of identical décor. The surface design of this vessel closely corresponds with that seen in pattern blocks found at Houma. Those finds point to Houma as the almost certain place of manufacture of this vessel, which was used for cooking food.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/28444/tripod-caldron-ding

They also use different types of pigments to create varying degrees of opacity.

Yuan Gu pointedly observed that the cart which had carried the grandfather to the forest would also serve to carry the father when he grew old. Made to realize his heartlessness, the father brought the grandfather home again. (Here the cart is depicted as a stretcher, carried by the figure at far left). In imperial China, this theme of “filial piety”—respect and support for parents and other elders—was a preeminent Confucian virtue.

They also use different types of pigments to create varying degrees of opacity. This work comes from a portfolio that was commissioned in 1999 by the Muban Foundation in London to recognize the achievements of Chinese printmakers.

In one of his most poignant poems, he compared the fleeting traces of human events to the footprints of geese (hong) left on snow (xue).The windows of the foreground building offer glimpses of the owner’s library and art collection: bronze and ceramic vessels, one painting rolled and stored upright, a desk for painting and calligraphy, and a tall, narrow stand for burning incense. An attendant prepares tea for gentlemen engaged in conversation in the pavilion, while women stroll in the adjacent bamboo garden. Large, eroded rocks are dramatically shaded to highlight their fantastic quality.Qian’s reserved, quietly spontaneous brushwork—bland, single-stroke architecture and ink-dots that echo the contours of hills, rocks, and trees—is inspired by the style of late 16th-century literati masters, with whom the affluent and well-traveled Qian Du was undoubtedly familiar.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/79572/the-xuehong-pavilion-in-a-scholar-s-garden

ch_538,,Bronze inlaid with gold and silver and inset with jade,Garment Hook,"The buttonlike knob on the back of this small garment hook served to fasten a belt or robe. A dragon of jade curls sinuously within its bronze mount—a composite creature combining a bull’s head and a serpentine body terminating in a fishlike tail curled over one horn. The dragon’s finely incised curls are echoed in a complex pattern of gold and silver embellishing the mount. Thin strands of these malleable metals, applied individually or compacted together into thicker ribbons, were pressed into grooves in the bronze, then ground flush with the surface and polished to a high luster. This combination of descriptive and abstract patterns—facial features, scales, volutes, and spirals—is a masterwork of metallic inlay.The jade dragon is datable about three hundred years earlier than the inlaid bronze garment hook in which it was carefully set. The exquisite “recycling” of ancient jades demonstrates their value to those who inherited or discovered such pieces and then custom-designed new contexts for their use.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/5918/garment-hook

ch_552,,Jade,Dragon Pendant,"These matching pendants were designed as serpentine dragons with backturned heads, coiled tails, and small fins that project above and below their undulating trunks. The rhythmic fluency of these creatures belies the unyielding quality of jade—a compact, fine-grained stone that cannot be carved and must be worn away with abrasive paste applied to its surface with saws, grinders, and drills. The craftsman’s remarkable dexterity with this intractable material is displayed in smoothly rounded, heart-shaped units and delicately incised spirals, striations, and cross-hatching that thoroughly enliven both the front and back surfaces. Their substantial size and thickness, technical refinement, and glossy polish point to aristocratic patronage. That these pendants were likely designed to drape down the owner’s shoulders or from a waistband is indicated by holes pierced for suspension through the creatures’ hindquarters. Toward the end of the Bronze Age when these pendants were created, sinuously curved dragons had become prominent motifs in many luxurious materials. Contemporary literature suggests that such dynamic creatures were not merely decorative but also envisioned as supernatural beings. When buried with the deceased, jade pendants like these may have reflected widely held beliefs in the dragon as a vehicle that could transport the human soul on its journey to the netherworld.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/70117/dragon-pendant

ch_555,Ren Yi,Hanging scroll; ink and colors on paper,Mynah and Lotus 鷯哥荷花圖,"Ren Yi was among the most successful and influential among Chinese painters of the so-called Shanghai School. Arriving in Shanghai in 1857, he took the artistic name “bonian” (one-hundred years), claiming that it would take him a century to achieve success. However, by 1875 Ren Yi was the best-known painter in Shanghai. His highly sought-after bird-and-flower paintings initially followed the Song dynasty (960–1279) convention of applying rich color fields within outlines, producing decorative patterning with lifelike representation. This work represents his mature, more spontaneous style that is characterized by looser brushwork, more ink washes, and greater tonal variation.The mynah bird, known for its perfect imitation of the human voice, was a favorite subject of the influential 17th-century painter Zhu Da (Bada Shanren). Known for his highly individualistic style, Zhu Da was particularly influential among Shanghai painters. The black form of the mynah was ideal for the expressive brushwork known as xieyi (“sketch conceptualism”); and for Zhu Da, the mynah was imbued with a cryptic, highly personal symbolic power. It is unclear whether Ren Yi consciously accessed Zhu Da’s symbolic usage of the bird as a rebuke of Chinese society in this painting. However, as indicated in the inscription, which states that the painting was a gift for a friend and antique shop owner, Ren Yi consciously “imitated” Zhu Da’s style as a tribute to the artist.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/46461/mynah-and-lotus-j-yie-gi%D1%9C-i%D1%99-e%D1%9A

Some graves afford evidence that the jade-laden body was burned during funerary rites.Intriguing forms and precisely executed surface designs characterize jade prisms. The inner cylinders were smoothly bored with a tubular drill, probably a shaft of bamboo. The tapered exterior surfaces are subdivided into tiers of masklike images composed of circles and bars, immediately suggesting eyes and nose or mouth. The Liangzhu may have attributed some magic, protective qualities to these masks.Prisms like this have been found only in tombs.

The precise ethnic identities of most of these tribes are unknown; ancient Chinese texts refer to many of these tribes by ancient regional names rather than by the names by which the tribes called themselves.The vigorous lifestyle of these nomadic horsemen is reflected in their bronzes, which originally embellished chariots, harness equipment, and personal accessories.

Rich in lead and barium, these beads are chemically distinct from those of soda-lime glass made in Greek and Roman workshops of the eastern Mediterranean and western Asia, rare examples of which have been discovered in north and northwest China. Those foreign imports inspired Chinese craftsmen to create their own polychrome beads.

Silks with woven patterns are rarely preserved but can be documented about one thousand years later, primarily through ghost-like imprints on jade implements as well as bronze vessels and weapons. Before burial, these prestigious ceremonial objects were evidently wrapped in fragile but fugitive silk fabrics.Preserved near the edge of this jade blade is a three-dimensional pseudomorph (“false form”) of a squared, tightly woven pattern, whose organic material has completely disintegrated and been replaced by minerals that duplicate the original textile structure. Under high magnification, this pattern displays a slight “Z” twist in the original filament thread, as characteristic of reeled silk that is simply woven (“plain weave.”).Such indirect but clearly preserved evidence of Shang dynasty silk is extraordinarily rare. The collective expertise of the Art Institute’s conservation scientists and scholars of Chinese textile history and technology have facilitated the identification of the material seen here.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/68715/dagger-blade-ge

ch_783,Ren Yi,Hanging scroll; ink and colors on paper,Paradise Flycatchers and Wisteria,"Ren Yi was among the most successful and influential among Chinese painters of the so-called Shanghai School. Arriving in Shanghai in 1857, he took the artistic name “bonian” (one-hundred years), claiming that it would take him a century to achieve success. However, by 1875 Ren Yi was the best-known painter in Shanghai. His highly sought-after bird-and-flower paintings initially followed the Song dynasty (960–1279) convention of applying rich color fields within outlines, producing decorative patterning with lifelike representation. This work represents his mature, more spontaneous style that is characterized by looser brushwork, more ink washes, and greater tonal variation.The contrast between the delicate flowers and thick vines of the wisteria make this plant ideal for showcasing an artist’s calligraphic prowess. In this painting, Ren Yi demonstrates his impressive range of brush techniques: dry, rough strokes dragged across the paper compose the wisteria vines; wet jumbles of short strokes imbue volume to the rocks; and subtle gradations of color dotted on the paper form the wisteria flowers. In the center sits a pair of paradise flycatchers. Their Chinese name, shoudai niao (sash bird), which describes the species’ long ribbonlike tails, is a homophone for the term shou (longevity). By combining a vibrant palette of colors, some of which were imported from Europe, with the bravado of his monochromatic brush technique, Ren Yi imbued past traditions with fresh innovation.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/46450/paradise-flycatchers-and-wisteria

On this object, the playful scene where the peddler eagerly approaches his young customers and carelessly leaves his goods unattended is captured through richly carved ivory. While adhering to the conventional composition of this scene in paintings, the circular shape of the medallion and the intricate relief carvings on the sumptuous ivory surface infuse this familiar image with a distinct dynamism.The reverse side of the medallion is decorated with carved floral patterns. The three small holes at the center indicate that the object was probably strung and hung, yet its precise function remains unknown.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/147006/the-knickknack-peddler

Under the emperor’s patronage, potters successfully introduced a white enamel with a base of lead arsenic. This innovation serves to opacify the colors and allows for finer gradations.This cup features the motif of the Buddha’s Hand (foshou), a nonedible yet fragrant citron characterized by its long “fingers.” The name of this fruit approximates the sounds of the Chinese words for happiness (fu) and longevity (shou).

Perhaps intending to emulate vibrant blue glass imported from the Middle East, Chinese potters applied this glaze to off-white earthenwares and low-fired stonewares that were intended primarily for burial. The source of Tang cobalt has been subject to ongoing debate. For many years, most scholars assumed that Chinese potters imported cobalt ore from the Middle East. Recent analyses of Tang blue glazes, however, show these to be chemically distinct from those of Middle Eastern ceramics and may indicate a domestic Chinese source for this colorant.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/80880/jar-with-cover

ch_916,,Gray earthenware with impressed and carved decoration,Pillar from Tomb Chamber,"In northern China during the Han dynasty, hollow clay bricks were used to construct the small, rectangular chambers of underground tombs. The doors, pillars, and lintel assembled here reconstruct the entrance to such a chamber. Before firing, the bricks were stamped with vigorous images from daily life and from mythology. This combination of subject matters reflects a dualistic view of the human soul: separating at death, one part of the soul was thought to remain in the earthly tomb, while the other ascended to a paradise—the realm of ancestral spirits and of the special beings who have achieved immortality.Guardian images, both realistic and symbolic, are centered on each door. Two long-robed men (identified by inscription as tingzhang, village officials) flank another protective symbol, a ring-snouted monster mask. Surrounding this central square are border strips depicting scenes of entertainment and of animals, hunters, and chariots charging across mountains. Winged xian—immortal, elf-like figures—are also depicted in a mountainous setting. Other emblematic designs that appear repeatedly on these doors include a spade-shaped evergreen tree, designating family continuity and longevity, and a disk enclosing a bird in flight, which can be identified with the sun.On the lintel above, soldiers bearing shields flank a protective monster mask. On either side of this mask, jade disks tied by cords may symbolize prosperity or other auspicious wishes for the soul. Other auspicious symbols include the dragon and phoenix (also known as the Red Bird), identified in Han cosmological texts as the animals of the east and south, respectively.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/12793/pillar-from-tomb-chamber

Yet this extremely playful lidded box, vividly crafted in the shape of two melons grown from a leafy vine, still stands out as a rare find. The box’s diminutive size and two internal compartments suggest that it was likely used as a cosmetic container on a lady’s dressing table. Characterized by its abundant seeds and winding vines, the melon was considered an auspicious symbol related to child-bearing and familial prosperity in traditional China.

Remarkably, this accelerated approach to decoration did not compromise the beauty of the final product. Inside the bowl, four fishes gracefully encircle a sea creature — either a crab or a squid — amidst the rippling waves. The surface of the bowl is fully covered in a glossy, translucent olive-green glaze. The glaze pools in the recesses, producing a slightly deeper hue that enhances the dynamism and vividness of the motifs. When filled with water or tea, the bowl brings the marine animals to life by creating an illusion of them swimming within the liquid.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/193014/conical-bowl-with-interior-of-fish-swimming-amid-waves-encircling-a-sea-crab-and-exterior-of-stylized-petals

The contrast between the unglazed decoration and the lustrous glazed surface accentuates the smoothness and shininess of the glaze, while also bringing attention to the intricate patterns on the appliqués – in the case of this object, two phoenixes elegantly encircling a jewel in the form of a floral stamen.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/195398/scalloped-rim-dish-with-confronted-phoenixes-and-floral-stamen

ch_1301,,Porcelain with blue glaze,Bottle Vase,"This porcelain vase features an even coating of a vibrant mottled turquoise glaze with speckles of deep red outlines. The extraordinary visual effect of this glaze, known as “robin’s egg” in English, is achieved by firing the turquoise glaze stippled with copper-red pigment at a lower temperature than that of the porcelain itself. Due to the low firing temperature, this glazing technique is referred to in Chinese as Lujun, or “furnace Jun.”The development of this technique during the mid-Qing period stemmed from the numerous efforts of imperial potters to replicate the glaze found on Jun wares from previous dynasties. While the Lujun glaze echoes the striking color contrast and freeforming patterns of Jun ware, it also maintains its own distinctive visual appeal, testifying to the craftsmanship and innovative spirits of Qing potters. Bearing a Qianlong reign mark, this vase was likely crafted upon the order of the Qianlong Emperor.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/42439/bottle-vase

The earliest scabbard slides, used by cavalry as well as nomadic tribes engaged in hunting and herding, were likely made of stone, wood, and metal. Nomadic horsemen who occupied China’s northern and Central Asian steppe regions likely introduced the scabbard slide to craftsmen in central and southern China, who designed elegant versions like this in jade. These, in turn, inspired imitations in commoner stones by later craftsmen of the steppe regions. The scabbard slide therefore seems to have traveled full circle—eastward to China and from there, westward again.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/70441/scabbard-slide

His constructions poetically transform fallen sticks and other found materials into large, sculptural structures meant to be destroyed in the winter and rebuilt each spring, echoing natural cycles of death and renewal. Although this project remains highly experimental in form, Cheng outlined a new kind of ritual space that provides a contemporary take on funerary and memorial traditions around the globe.

This surface quality hints at the rock’s potential origin in Lingbi, Anhui province – the renowned source of the finest scholar’s rocks. Sometimes, the found rocks were carved to enhance their visual appeal.

This area was occupied by distinctive cultures that coexisted with the Shang and Western Zhou dynasties. Along this southern frontier, it appears that large bronze bells were more important than bronze vessels to the local aristocracy.This bell was designed to be mounted on its hollow stem with its curved mouth facing up and struck from the outside with a mallet. Unlike other types of bronze bells that were assembled as chime sets, this one was intended to be played as an individual instrument. It may have been sounded during ceremonies or military campaigns. The eyebrow-shaped lines that skim the margins of this bell depict imaginary dragons or realistic reptiles.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/12086/bell-nao

He can be identified by the small figure of Amituo (Amitabha), Buddha of the Western Paradise, in his headdress. His pose—seated with one leg hanging and his right arm resting on the other knee—further distinguishes him as Guanyin of the Southern Sea, a reference to the deity’s island home. The figure’s gentle expression makes an emotional appeal to the viewer, which is typical of Chinese sculpture from the Song dynasty (960–1279). The carving was originally painted with intricately patterned robes and traces of color are still visible on his back. Later—probably during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644)—the wood was covered entirely with gold.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/9259/seated-guanyin

Rich in lead and barium, these beads are chemically distinct from those of soda-lime glass made in Greek and Roman workshops of the eastern Mediterranean and western Asia, rare examples of which have been discovered in north and northwest China. Those foreign imports inspired Chinese craftsmen to create their own polychrome beads. Their burial contexts—strung together with jades to form pendant sets, or inlaid into bronze objects such as mirrors and garment hooks—indicate that Chinese patrons easily integrated these new creations into traditional art forms.",https://www.artic.edu/artworks/129744/bead
